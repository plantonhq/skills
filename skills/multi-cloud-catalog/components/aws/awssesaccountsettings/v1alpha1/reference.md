AwsSesAccountSettingsSpec defines SES (SESv2) account-level
settings for one AWS region: the account suppression list and the
Virtual Deliverability Manager (VDM) posture.

This is a SETTINGS SINGLETON: AWS keeps exactly one SES account
object per account+region, and this component manages its
account-wide attributes. Deploy at most one instance per region;
two instances targeting the same region fight over the same
account object. metadata.name never reaches AWS - it is
Planton-side identity only. These settings are deliberately NOT
fields on AwsSesConfigurationSet or AwsSesEmailIdentity - multiple
sets/identities would fight over the one account object.

Destroy semantics DIFFER per arm (both taught on the arms below):
suppression settings PERSIST after destroy; the VDM arm is reset to
disabled.

## Example

```yaml
# Canonical AwsSesAccountSettings example (hack/dev manifest and
# refgen Example source): the recommended reputation posture -- both
# suppression reasons on, VDM enabled with engagement metrics.
apiVersion: aws.planton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: AwsSesAccountSettings
metadata:
  name: ses-account-us-west-2
  id: ses-account-us-west-2
  org: test-org
  env: dev
spec:
  region: us-west-2
  suppression:
    reasons:
      - BOUNCE
      - COMPLAINT
  vdm:
    enabled: true
    engagementMetrics: true
```

## Spec Fields

| Path | Type | Required | Default | References |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `spec.region` | `string` | yes |  |  |
| `spec.suppression` | `AwsSesAccountSettingsSuppression` |  |  |  |
| `spec.suppression.reasons` | `[]string` |  |  |  |
| `spec.vdm` | `AwsSesAccountSettingsVdm` |  |  |  |
| `spec.vdm.enabled` | `bool` |  |  |  |
| `spec.vdm.engagementMetrics` | `bool` |  |  |  |
| `spec.vdm.optimizedSharedDelivery` | `bool` |  |  |  |

## Field Details

### spec.region

`string` · required

The AWS region whose SES account settings this instance manages.
The region IS the resource identity - one instance per region.
Example: "us-west-2", "eu-west-1"

- rule: {"string":{"minLen":"1"}}

### spec.suppression

`AwsSesAccountSettingsSuppression`

The account-level suppression list configuration. Omit the arm to
leave the account's suppression settings untouched; set it with
an empty reasons list to explicitly turn account-level
auto-suppression OFF.

### spec.suppression.reasons

`[]string`

Which events auto-suppress a recipient:
  - "BOUNCE": hard bounces add the address to the list.
  - "COMPLAINT": spam complaints add the address to the list.
Both together is the recommended reputation posture. An EMPTY
list is meaningful: it explicitly disables account-level
auto-suppression (configuration sets can still enable their own).

Applying this arm overwrites whatever was previously set - and
the setting PERSISTS after this component is destroyed (SES has
no delete for it; the last-applied reasons stay in effect). To
stop suppressing, apply an empty list before destroying.

- rule: {"repeated":{"unique":true,"items":{"string":{"in":["BOUNCE","COMPLAINT"]}}}}

### spec.vdm

`AwsSesAccountSettingsVdm`

The Virtual Deliverability Manager (VDM) posture - SES's
deliverability analytics suite. Omit the arm to leave the
account's VDM state untouched.

### spec.vdm.enabled

`bool`

Master switch for VDM on the account. Destroying this component
resets VDM to disabled (unlike the suppression arm, this one IS
reverted on destroy). VDM carries its own AWS pricing - enabling
it is a billing decision, not just a feature flag.

### spec.vdm.engagementMetrics

`bool` · optional (explicit presence)

Track open/click engagement metrics in the VDM dashboard. Unset
leaves AWS's default for the account; only meaningful while
enabled is true.

### spec.vdm.optimizedSharedDelivery

`bool` · optional (explicit presence)

Let Guardian optimize shared-delivery behavior (SES adjusts
sending patterns to protect deliverability). Unset leaves AWS's
default for the account; only meaningful while enabled is true.

## Validation Rules

- `spec.at_least_one_arm`: configure at least one of suppression / vdm - an instance managing neither is dead configuration

## Outputs

Reference an output from another manifest as `valueFrom: {kind: AwsSesAccountSettings, name: <resource-name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.<output>}`.

| Output | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `status.outputs.account_id` | `string` | The 12-digit AWS account ID the settings belong to (also the provider's import ID for the suppression singleton). |
