AwsCloudwatchLogDeliverySpec defines the two ways logs leave
CloudWatch, as two independently deployable arms:

The VENDED arm is the modern delivery framework: a delivery SOURCE
wraps one AWS resource whose service vends logs (CloudFront access
logs, Bedrock knowledge-base logs, SES mail events, ...), owned
delivery DESTINATIONS wrap where logs land (S3, CloudWatch Logs,
Firehose, X-Ray), and DELIVERIES join this source to destinations -
owned ones by name or destinations that exist elsewhere by ARN. One
instance owns at most one source; a destination shared by many
sources is owned by one instance and referenced by ARN from the
rest.

The CROSS-ACCOUNT arm is the legacy subscription destination: a
named Kinesis-backed receiving endpoint (with its access policy)
that OTHER accounts' subscription filters target. Its access policy
PERSISTS at AWS after destroy - deleting the destination is real,
deleting the policy alone is a provider no-op.

## Example

```yaml
# Canonical AwsCloudwatchLogDelivery example (hack/dev manifest and
# refgen Example source): a vended pipeline (a Bedrock knowledge base's
# application logs delivered to an owned S3 destination with a
# cross-account grant) plus the legacy cross-account Kinesis
# destination arm. Literal values stand in for composed references so
# the offline `tofu plan` renders every arm.

## Field Details

### spec.region

`string` · required

The AWS region the delivery objects live in. Example:
"us-east-1".

- rule: {"string":{"minLen":"1"}}

### spec.vended

`AwsVendedLogDelivery`

The vended-log delivery arm.

- rule: configure a source, at least one owned destination, or both
- rule: deliveries join this instance's source to destinations - configure the source or drop the deliveries
- rule: destinations entries must have unique names
- rule: deliveries entries must have unique names
- rule: each delivery's destination_name must match a destinations entry

### spec.vended.source

`AwsVendedLogSource`

The delivery source: the AWS resource whose vended logs this
pipeline carries.

### spec.vended.source.name

`string` · required

The source's name in AWS (its identity - renaming replaces it).

- rule: {"string":{"minLen":"1","maxLen":"60"}}

### spec.vended.source.logType

`string` · required

The log type this source vends, as the producing service names it
(e.g. "ACCESS_LOGS" for CloudFront, "APPLICATION_LOGS" for
Bedrock knowledge bases - each service's vended-logs docs list its
types). Changing it replaces the source.

- rule: {"string":{"minLen":"1","maxLen":"255"}}

### spec.vended.source.resourceArn

`string | valueFrom` · required

ARN of the resource whose logs this source vends (a CloudFront
distribution, a Bedrock knowledge base, ...). Any vended-logs
producer works - reference the producing kind's ARN output or
pass a literal ARN. Changing it replaces the source.

- rule: {"required":true}
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: <Kind>, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.<output>}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.vended.destinations

`[]AwsVendedLogDestination`

Owned delivery destinations, keyed by name. A destination shared
by many pipelines lives in ONE owning instance; other instances
reference it by ARN in their deliveries.

- rule: destination_resource_arn is required unless delivery_destination_type is XRAY (which forbids it)

### spec.vended.destinations[].name

`string` · required

The destination's name in AWS (its identity - renaming replaces
it). Also the key deliveries join on.

- rule: {"string":{"minLen":"1","maxLen":"60"}}

### spec.vended.destinations[].destinationResourceArn

`string | valueFrom`

ARN of the receiving resource: an S3 bucket, a CloudWatch log
group, or a Firehose delivery stream. AWS infers the destination
type from the ARN's service. Forbidden for XRAY destinations.

- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: <Kind>, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.<output>}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.vended.destinations[].deliveryDestinationType

`string`

The destination's type. Usually unset - AWS derives it from
destination_resource_arn. XRAY must be declared explicitly (it
has no ARN to infer from).

- rule: {"ignore":"IGNORE_IF_ZERO_VALUE","string":{"in":["S3","CWL","FH","XRAY"]}}

### spec.vended.destinations[].outputFormat

`string`

The wire format written to the destination. Unset keeps AWS's
default for the destination type. Changing it replaces the
destination.

- rule: {"ignore":"IGNORE_IF_ZERO_VALUE","string":{"in":["json","plain","w3c","raw","parquet"]}}

### spec.vended.destinations[].policy

`object`

The destination's resource policy - the cross-account grant
letting OTHER accounts' delivery sources deliver here. Statements
allow logs:CreateDelivery to the producer accounts. Unset for
same-account pipelines.

### spec.vended.deliveries

`[]AwsVendedLogDeliveryEntry`

The deliveries joining this source to destinations. AWS allows at
most one delivery per (source, destination-type) pair - e.g. one
to S3 plus one to Firehose, never two to S3.

- rule: set exactly one of destination_name (an owned destination) and destination_arn (a destination that exists elsewhere)

### spec.vended.deliveries[].name

`string` · required

The delivery's name within this instance - the key the modules
use for the for_each entry and the outputs map. Planton-side
only; AWS identifies deliveries by a generated ID.

- rule: {"string":{"minLen":"1","maxLen":"63"}}

### spec.vended.deliveries[].destinationName

`string`

An owned destination's name (a destinations entry in this spec).

- rule: {"ignore":"IGNORE_IF_ZERO_VALUE"}

### spec.vended.deliveries[].destinationArn

`string | valueFrom`

ARN of a delivery destination that exists elsewhere - another
instance's owned destination (reference its
destination_arns output) or any pre-existing one.

- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: <Kind>, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.<output>}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.vended.deliveries[].recordFields

`[]string`

The record fields written per log event, in order. Unset delivers
the source's default field set (each log type documents its
fields).

- rule: {"repeated":{"maxItems":"128","items":{"string":{"minLen":"1","maxLen":"64"}}}}

### spec.vended.deliveries[].fieldDelimiter

`string`

The field delimiter for plain/w3c text formats (up to 5
characters). Unset keeps the format's default.

- rule: {"ignore":"IGNORE_IF_ZERO_VALUE","string":{"maxLen":"5"}}

### spec.vended.deliveries[].s3Configuration

`AwsVendedLogS3DeliveryConfiguration`

S3-destination layout settings. Ignored for non-S3 destinations.

### spec.vended.deliveries[].s3Configuration.enableHiveCompatiblePath

`bool`

Write Hive-compatible key paths (year=.../month=... partitions),
so Athena/Glue partition discovery works out of the box.

### spec.vended.deliveries[].s3Configuration.suffixPath

`string`

The key suffix path under the destination bucket. For CloudFront
sources AWS silently prepends "AWSLogs/{account-id}/CloudFront/";
both engines store the suffix WITHOUT that AWS-added prefix, so
configure only your own path segment here.

- rule: {"ignore":"IGNORE_IF_ZERO_VALUE"}

### spec.crossAccountDestination

`AwsCrossAccountLogDestination`

The legacy cross-account subscription destination arm.

### spec.crossAccountDestination.name

`string` · required

The destination's name (its identity - renaming replaces it). No
colons or asterisks, up to 512 characters.

- rule: {"string":{"minLen":"1","maxLen":"512","pattern":"^[^:*]*$"}}

### spec.crossAccountDestination.roleArn

`string | valueFrom` · required

The role CloudWatch Logs assumes to write into the Kinesis
stream. Its trust policy must allow logs.amazonaws.com; IAM
propagation makes the first create eventually consistent (both
engines retry for up to two minutes). Reference an AwsIamRole
role_arn output or pass a literal ARN.

- references: AwsIamRole (`status.outputs.role_arn`)
- rule: {"required":true}
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: AwsIamRole, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.role_arn}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.crossAccountDestination.targetArn

`string | valueFrom` · required

The Kinesis stream that receives the forwarded log events.
Reference an AwsKinesisStream stream_arn output or pass a literal
ARN.

- references: AwsKinesisStream (`status.outputs.stream_arn`)
- rule: {"required":true}
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: AwsKinesisStream, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.stream_arn}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.crossAccountDestination.accessPolicy

`object` · required

The destination's access policy: which accounts/principals may
logs:PutSubscriptionFilter against this destination. Write AWS
principals as BARE ACCOUNT IDs ("AWS": "123456789012") - the
service rejects the ARN form with "Principal section of policy
contains ARN instead of account ID: arn:aws:iam::...:root"
(server contract; the usual IAM root-ARN spelling is invalid
here). In YAML, QUOTE the id: an unquoted account id parses as a
number and IAM's grammar rejects a numeric principal ("Error
occurred while parsing accessPolicy"). NOTE the AWS contract:
destroying the policy alone never removes it - only destroying
the whole destination does.

- rule: {"required":true}

### spec.crossAccountDestination.forceUpdate

`bool` · optional (explicit presence)

Update the policy even while it is actively in use by
subscription filters. Unset keeps AWS's default behavior.

## Validation Rules

- `spec.at_least_one_arm`: configure the vended arm, the cross_account_destination arm, or both - an empty spec manages nothing

## Outputs

Reference an output from another manifest as `valueFrom: {kind: AwsCloudwatchLogDelivery, name: <resource-name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.<output>}`.

| Output | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|

| `status.outputs.source_name` | `string` | The vended source's name. |
| `status.outputs.source_service` | `string` | The service AWS recorded as the source's producer (derived from resource_arn). |
| `status.outputs.destination_arns` | `map<string, string>` | Owned destination ARNs keyed by destination name - what other instances' deliveries reference. |
| `status.outputs.delivery_ids` | `map<string, string>` | AWS-generated delivery IDs keyed by delivery name (each delivery imports by this ID). |
| `status.outputs.delivery_arns` | `map<string, string>` | Delivery ARNs keyed by delivery name. |
| `status.outputs.cross_account_destination_arn` | `string` | The cross-account destination's ARN - what other accounts' subscription filters target. Empty without that arm. |
| `status.outputs.cross_account_destination_name` | `string` | The cross-account destination's name (the provider's import ID for it). |
