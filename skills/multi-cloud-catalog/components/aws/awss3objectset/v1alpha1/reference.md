AwsS3ObjectSetSpec defines a set of S3 objects declaratively managed in a
single target bucket — configuration files, static website assets, seed
data, Lambda deployment artifacts, and any other content that should be
created, updated, and destroyed alongside the infrastructure that consumes
it.

Each entry in `objects` is one managed object: the object key, its source
(inline UTF-8 text, base64-encoded binary, or a server-side COPY of an
existing S3 object), and the full per-object HTTP/storage surface (content
headers, user metadata, storage class, encryption override, checksum,
Object Lock retention, canned ACL, tags). Content-sourced entries render as
`aws_s3_object`; copy-sourced entries render as `aws_s3_object_copy` — the
data never travels through the deploy host either way.

Division of responsibility with AwsS3Bucket — read this before reaching for
the per-object security knobs:
- Uniform posture belongs on the BUCKET. Default encryption (SSE algorithm,
  KMS key, bucket key), versioning, public-access blocking, and ownership
  controls are bucket-level settings on AwsS3Bucket, and S3 applies them to
  every uploaded object automatically.
- The per-object `server_side_encryption` / `kms_key` / `bucket_key_enabled`
  / `acl` fields here are OVERRIDES for individual objects that must diverge
  from the bucket's posture. If every object in the set carries the same
  override, the setting is in the wrong place — move it to the bucket.

Key behaviors:
- `key` is the object's identity. Changing a key replaces that object
  (delete + create); changing only content updates it in place. A
  copy-sourced object re-copies in place when its copy settings change.
- On a versioning-enabled bucket, destroying an object removes ALL of its
  versions.
- Object Lock fields require the BUCKET to have been created with Object
  Lock enabled; on a regular bucket they fail at apply time — and so does
  `force_destroy`, whose only job is bypassing GOVERNANCE-mode retention
  during delete.

## Example

```yaml
# Full-surface development manifest. Exercises every spec arm — including the
# ones the live E2E lanes exclude (acl needs an ACL-permitting bucket
# ownership posture, Object Lock needs a lock-enabled bucket, SSE-KMS needs a
# real key ARN) — so the offline tofu plan / pulumi preview proof covers the
# complete contract.

## Field Details

### spec.region

`string` · required

The AWS region where the target bucket lives. Must match the bucket's own
region — S3 PutObject is a regional API.
Example: "us-west-2", "eu-west-1"

- rule: {"string":{"minLen":"1"}}

### spec.bucket

`string | valueFrom` · required

The target S3 bucket for every object in the set.
Can be a literal bucket name or a reference to an AwsS3Bucket component
(resolved from status.outputs.bucket_id). The literal arm also accepts an
access-point ARN or an S3 Express directory-bucket name for buckets
managed outside this catalog.

- references: AwsS3Bucket (`status.outputs.bucket_id`)
- rule: {"required":true}
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: AwsS3Bucket, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.bucket_id}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.objects

`[]AwsS3Object` · required

The objects to upload. At least one. Each object's `key` must be unique
within the set — both engines key the underlying provider resources by it.

- rule: {"repeated":{"minItems":"1"}}
- rule: Exactly one of content, content_base64, or copy_from must be specified
- rule: metadata and header fields (cache_control, content_encoding, content_disposition, content_language, website_redirect) on a copy-sourced object require copy_from.replace_metadata: true — a COPY-directive copy preserves the source's metadata and ignores them
- rule: object_lock_mode and object_lock_retain_until_date must be set together
- rule: kms_key requires server_side_encryption to be unset, aws:kms, or aws:kms:dsse

### spec.objects[].key

`string` · required

The S3 object key — the object's full path within the bucket and its
identity in this set. Changing the key replaces the object.
Examples: "config/app.json", "assets/logo.png", "data/seed.csv"

- rule: {"string":{"minLen":"1"}}

### spec.objects[].content

`string`

Inline UTF-8 text content.
Suitable for configuration files, JSON, YAML, HTML, and other text.

### spec.objects[].contentBase64

`string`

Base64-encoded binary content.
Suitable for images, zip archives, or any binary payload small enough
to carry in a manifest.

### spec.objects[].copyFrom

`AwsS3ObjectCopyFrom`

Server-side copy of an existing S3 object (any size — the bytes move
inside S3, never through the deploy host). Suitable for promoting
build artifacts between buckets, seeding environments from a golden
bucket, or re-homing objects with new placement/encryption. The copy
is taken at deploy time; it does not track later changes to the
source object.

### spec.objects[].copyFrom.sourceBucket

`string | valueFrom` · required

The bucket holding the source object.
Can be a literal bucket name or a reference to an AwsS3Bucket component
(resolved from status.outputs.bucket_id). The literal arm also accepts
an S3 access-point ARN (`arn:aws:s3:<region>:<account>:accesspoint/
<name>`) for sources reached through an access point. The deploying
principal needs s3:GetObject on the source.

- references: AwsS3Bucket (`status.outputs.bucket_id`)
- rule: {"required":true}
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: AwsS3Bucket, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.bucket_id}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.objects[].copyFrom.sourceKey

`string` · required

The key of the source object within `source_bucket`.
Example: "releases/v1.2.3/app.zip"

- rule: {"string":{"minLen":"1"}}

### spec.objects[].copyFrom.replaceMetadata

`bool`

Replace the destination object's user metadata and content headers
instead of preserving the source's (S3's REPLACE metadata directive).
When true, the owning object's `metadata`, `content_type`,
`cache_control`, `content_encoding`, `content_disposition`,
`content_language`, and `website_redirect` are written to the copy;
when false (the default) those fields must stay unset and the copy
keeps everything the source object carried.

### spec.objects[].copyFrom.copyIfMatch

`string`

Copy only if the source object's current ETag matches this value
(a precondition evaluated by S3 at copy time; a failed precondition
fails the deploy). Guards promotions against a source that changed
since the ETag was recorded.

### spec.objects[].copyFrom.copyIfNoneMatch

`string`

Copy only if the source object's current ETag does NOT match this
value.

### spec.objects[].copyFrom.copyIfModifiedSince

`string`

Copy only if the source object was modified after this RFC 3339
timestamp (e.g. "2026-08-01T00:00:00Z").

- rule: copy_if_modified_since must be an RFC 3339 timestamp, e.g. 2026-08-01T00:00:00Z

### spec.objects[].copyFrom.copyIfUnmodifiedSince

`string`

Copy only if the source object has NOT been modified since this RFC
3339 timestamp.

- rule: copy_if_unmodified_since must be an RFC 3339 timestamp, e.g. 2026-08-01T00:00:00Z

### spec.objects[].copyFrom.expires

`string`

The Expires header stored with the copied object, as an RFC 3339
timestamp — the date after which the content is considered stale by
caches. Only the copy path offers this header (the provider's
content-object resource carries no expires argument).

- rule: expires must be an RFC 3339 timestamp, e.g. 2027-01-01T00:00:00Z

### spec.objects[].copyFrom.requestPayer

`string`

Confirms the copier pays request and data-transfer costs when the
SOURCE bucket is a Requester Pays bucket. The only accepted value is
"requester" — S3 rejects copies from Requester Pays buckets without
this acknowledgment.

- rule: request_payer accepts only "requester"

### spec.objects[].contentType

`string` · optional (explicit presence)

The MIME content type stored with the object and returned as the
Content-Type header on every GET. Set it correctly for anything a
browser will fetch (e.g. "text/html", "application/json", "image/png") —
the default is the generic binary type, which browsers download instead
of rendering.
Default: application/octet-stream

- default: `application/octet-stream`

### spec.objects[].cacheControl

`string`

The Cache-Control header stored with the object, governing CDN and
browser caching. Examples: "max-age=86400" (cache for 24h),
"no-cache" (revalidate every time), "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
(fingerprinted static assets).

### spec.objects[].contentEncoding

`string`

The Content-Encoding header stored with the object. Set this when the
content is pre-compressed (e.g. "gzip", "br") so clients decompress it
transparently. The content itself must already be encoded — S3 does not
compress.

### spec.objects[].contentDisposition

`string`

The Content-Disposition header stored with the object, controlling
whether browsers render inline or download. Examples: "inline",
"attachment; filename=\"report.pdf\"".

### spec.objects[].contentLanguage

`string`

The Content-Language header stored with the object — the natural
language(s) of the content, e.g. "en-US".

### spec.objects[].metadata

`map<string, string>`

User-defined metadata stored with the object and returned as
x-amz-meta-* headers. Keys must be lowercase (the S3 API lowercases them
on storage; requiring lowercase here keeps the manifest identical to
what reads back and avoids phantom drift). Note: metadata is immutable
in S3 — changing it rewrites the object.

- rule: {"map":{"keys":{"string":{"pattern":"^[^A-Z]*$"}}}}

### spec.objects[].websiteRedirect

`string`

The x-amz-website-redirect-location value: when the bucket is configured
for static website hosting, a GET of this object's key redirects to the
target instead of serving content — either another key in the same site
("/new-page.html") or an absolute URL ("https://example.com/moved").
Stored but inert on buckets without website hosting.

### spec.objects[].storageClass

`string`

The storage class for the object, trading retrieval latency/cost against
storage cost. Unset uses STANDARD.

- "STANDARD": general purpose; the default.
- "STANDARD_IA" / "ONEZONE_IA": infrequent access — cheaper storage,
  per-GB retrieval fee, 30-day minimum billing (ONEZONE_IA is single-AZ).
- "INTELLIGENT_TIERING": automatic tiering by access pattern; the safe
  choice when access patterns are unknown.
- "GLACIER_IR": archive with millisecond access; 90-day minimum.
- "GLACIER" / "DEEP_ARCHIVE": archive requiring asynchronous restore
  before reads (minutes-to-hours / hours); 90/180-day minimums. Rarely
  right for declaratively managed objects, which are typically read.
- "REDUCED_REDUNDANCY": legacy, not recommended.
- "EXPRESS_ONEZONE": S3 Express — valid only when the bucket is a
  directory bucket (literal bucket arm).
- "OUTPOSTS" / "SNOW" / "FSX_OPENZFS" / "FSX_ONTAP": valid only when the
  literal bucket arm targets the matching special infrastructure
  (Outposts access point, Snow device, FSx-backed access point).

- rule: storage_class must be one of STANDARD, REDUCED_REDUNDANCY, STANDARD_IA, ONEZONE_IA, INTELLIGENT_TIERING, GLACIER, GLACIER_IR, DEEP_ARCHIVE, EXPRESS_ONEZONE, OUTPOSTS, SNOW, FSX_OPENZFS, FSX_ONTAP

### spec.objects[].serverSideEncryption

`string`

Per-object server-side encryption OVERRIDE. Leave unset to inherit the
bucket's default encryption (the recommended posture — configure it on
AwsS3Bucket). Set only for individual objects that must diverge.

- "AES256": SSE-S3 (S3-managed keys).
- "aws:kms": SSE-KMS with the key in `kms_key` (or the account's
  aws/s3 key when no key is given).
- "aws:kms:dsse": dual-layer SSE-KMS (two independent encryption layers;
  compliance-driven).
- "aws:fsx": valid only when the literal bucket arm targets an
  FSx-backed access point.

- rule: server_side_encryption must be one of AES256, aws:kms, aws:kms:dsse, aws:fsx

### spec.objects[].kmsKey

`string | valueFrom`

The KMS key for SSE-KMS encryption of this object, as a key ARN.
Can be a literal ARN or a reference to an AwsKmsKey component. Setting a
key implies "aws:kms" encryption when `server_side_encryption` is unset;
combining it with "AES256" is contradictory and rejected. The deploying
principal needs kms:GenerateDataKey on the key.

- references: AwsKmsKey (`status.outputs.key_arn`)
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: AwsKmsKey, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.key_arn}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.objects[].bucketKeyEnabled

`bool` · optional (explicit presence)

Whether this object uses an S3 Bucket Key for SSE-KMS, batching KMS
requests to cut KMS costs. Only meaningful with "aws:kms" encryption.
Unset inherits the bucket's default; an explicit false opts this object
out even when the bucket enables bucket keys.

### spec.objects[].checksumAlgorithm

`string`

The checksum algorithm S3 uses to verify upload integrity and store an
additional object checksum (retrievable via GetObjectAttributes).
"CRC64NVME" is AWS's current full-object recommendation; the SHA variants
suit compliance regimes that mandate them. Unset relies on the default
TLS/MD5 integrity protection only.

- rule: checksum_algorithm must be one of CRC32, CRC32C, CRC64NVME, SHA1, SHA256

### spec.objects[].objectLockMode

`string`

Object Lock retention mode for this object version. Requires the BUCKET
to have Object Lock enabled (an immutable create-time bucket setting)
and must be paired with `object_lock_retain_until_date`.

- "GOVERNANCE": privileged principals (s3:BypassGovernanceRetention) can
  override the retention.
- "COMPLIANCE": nobody — including the root user — can shorten it.
  The object version genuinely cannot be deleted until the date passes;
  destroy will fail until then.

- rule: object_lock_mode must be GOVERNANCE or COMPLIANCE

### spec.objects[].objectLockRetainUntilDate

`string`

The date until which this object version is retained under
`object_lock_mode`, as an RFC 3339 timestamp (e.g.
"2027-01-01T00:00:00Z"). Required with, and only valid with,
`object_lock_mode`.

- rule: object_lock_retain_until_date must be an RFC 3339 timestamp, e.g. 2027-01-01T00:00:00Z

### spec.objects[].objectLockLegalHoldStatus

`string`

Object Lock legal hold for this object version — an indefinite deletion
block independent of retention mode, toggled on ("ON") and off ("OFF")
by principals with s3:PutObjectLegalHold. Requires an Object
Lock-enabled bucket.

- rule: object_lock_legal_hold_status must be ON or OFF

### spec.objects[].acl

`string`

Canned ACL for this object. Leave unset for every modern bucket:
AwsS3Bucket's default ownership posture (BucketOwnerEnforced) DISABLES
object ACLs, and setting one fails at apply time with
AccessControlListNotSupported. Only buckets whose object_ownership is
relaxed to BucketOwnerPreferred or ObjectWriter accept ACLs — a legacy
pattern; prefer bucket policies for public access.

- rule: acl must be one of private, public-read, public-read-write, authenticated-read, aws-exec-read, bucket-owner-read, bucket-owner-full-control

### spec.objects[].forceDestroy

`bool`

Allow this object to be deleted even while under GOVERNANCE-mode Object
Lock retention or a legal hold, by sending the governance-bypass flag
with the delete (the deploying principal needs
s3:BypassGovernanceRetention). ONLY valid on Object Lock-enabled
buckets — S3 rejects the bypass flag on regular buckets, failing the
destroy. Not needed for ordinary versioned-bucket cleanup: destroying an
object always removes all of its versions. COMPLIANCE-mode retention
cannot be bypassed by anyone.

### spec.objects[].tags

`map<string, string>`

Tags specific to this object. Merged with set-level tags (object tags
take precedence on key collisions).

### spec.tags

`map<string, string>`

Tags applied to every object in the set.
Individual object tags are merged on top, with object-level tags taking
precedence on key collisions.

## Outputs

Reference an output from another manifest as `valueFrom: {kind: AwsS3ObjectSet, name: <resource-name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.<output>}`.

| Output | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `status.outputs.bucket_id` | `string` | The bucket the objects were uploaded to. Carried for downstream references and for E2E verification (HeadObject per key). |
| `status.outputs.object_arns` | `map<string, string>` | Map of object key to its ARN (arn:aws:s3:::bucket/key). Composes into IAM policy Resource lists that must grant access to exactly these objects. |
| `status.outputs.object_etags` | `map<string, string>` | Map of object key to its ETag (content hash). The ETag changes when the object content changes, useful for cache invalidation. |
| `status.outputs.object_version_ids` | `map<string, string>` | Map of object key to its version ID. Only populated when the target bucket has versioning enabled. |
