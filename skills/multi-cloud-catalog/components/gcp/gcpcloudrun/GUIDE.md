# GcpCloudRun Guide

The judgment this guide protects: a Cloud Run service is two objects
wearing one name — a stable serving endpoint and a revision template —
and almost every operational mistake comes from conflating them. Endpoint
decisions (ingress, invoker policy, traffic split) take effect in place;
template decisions (containers, scaling, networking) only ever take
effect by stamping out a NEW immutable revision. Know which side of the
line a change lives on and deploys stop being surprising.

## The auth split is one decision, three dials

`allowUnauthenticated` grants public access THROUGH the IAM check (an
`allUsers` invoker grant); `invokerIamDisabled` turns the check OFF
entirely (for org policies that forbid `allUsers` grants); `iapEnabled`
puts Google's login wall in front of everything. The spec refuses the
first two together, and IAP with public access is a contradiction in
intent — behind IAP, let IAP be the front door. Services behind the
composed load balancer should also set ingress to
`INTERNAL_LOAD_BALANCER` and consider `defaultUriDisabled: true`: the
default *.run.app URL is the second front door everyone forgets, and
disabling it is the difference between "we route through the LB" and
"traffic CANNOT bypass the LB".

## Probes: three types, three jobs, three shapes

Startup gates first traffic (HTTP/TCP/gRPC — its whole window is capped
at 240 seconds: `failureThreshold × periodSeconds`); liveness restarts a
broken instance (HTTP/gRPC only — the spec has no TCP arm because the
API rejects it, and timing may stretch to 3600s for expensive checks);
readiness pulls an instance from serving WITHOUT restarting it and
re-admits it as soon as a probe succeeds again. There is no
success-threshold dial: the GA API's probe message carries no such
field (the Terraform provider models one, but the control plane
silently drops it — re-admission is single-success by design). Reach
for readiness when the failure is recoverable (a saturated downstream,
a cache warm) — restarting those instances (liveness) makes the
incident worse.
Never point liveness at an endpoint that calls your dependencies: one
slow downstream becomes a fleet-wide restart storm.

## The cost model lives in three fields

`resources.cpuIdle` (default true) is request-based billing — CPU only
while serving; set it false and every instance bills for its lifetime,
which is what real background work needs and what idle services waste.
`scaling.minInstanceCount` buys away cold starts at idle cost.
`serviceScaling.maxInstanceCount` is the service-WIDE bill cap across
revisions — during a rollout two revisions serve at once, and
per-revision caps double the worst case exactly when finance is
watching. MANUAL mode pins the fleet regardless of traffic: a load-test
lever and an emergency brake, not an operating mode.

## Deploy from source is a build-system decision

`buildConfig` makes GCP the build system (the Cloud Run functions path):
source in a GCS archive, Cloud Build produces the image, optionally in a
private worker pool under a dedicated build identity. Its quiet payoff
is `enableAutomaticUpdates` + the containers' `baseImageUri`: Google
patches OS/runtime layers of the running image with no redeploy. Teams
with a CI/CD pipeline should keep shipping images — mixing pipeline
images and source deploys on one service makes "what is running" a
research project.

## Multi-region is a different resource wearing the same kind

`multiRegionSettings` with `region: global` deploys one service identity
into several regions at once — but the deeper choice is between that and
the composition this catalog already proves: one service per region
behind a global load balancer (serverless NEGs). The composed path gives
per-region rollout control, per-region traffic evidence, and custom
domains; multi-region gives one object to manage. Prefer composition for
production estates; multi-region for fleets of identical internal
services where per-region ceremony is pure overhead.

## Destroy stance

`deletionProtection` (default true) is the API-side guard — the delete
itself fails until the manifest opts out. `deletionPolicy` layers the
engine-side stance under it: PREVENT fails any destroying plan before it
starts; ABANDON drops the service from state and leaves it serving —
break-glass for state surgery, not an operating mode. Deleting a service
tears down its endpoint AND every revision; the URL is gone the moment
the destroy lands.

## On the diagram

The service consumes `GcpProject`, `GcpServiceAccount` (runtime
identity), `GcpKmsKey` (image CMEK), `GcpCloudSql` (socket volumes),
`GcpGcsBucket` (FUSE volumes), and `GcpVpcNetwork`/`GcpSubnetwork`
(direct VPC egress). Its `service_name` output is the handle
`GcpRegionNetworkEndpointGroup` bridges into the load-balancer family —
the custom-domain path — and `url` is what application configs and
Pub/Sub push subscriptions consume.

## Pairs well with

- `GcpRegionNetworkEndpointGroup` — the bridge into the HTTPS load
  balancer; the production custom-domain path.
- `GcpServiceAccount` — a dedicated least-privilege runtime identity;
  the Compute default SA is for experiments only.
- `GcpCloudSql` — managed Unix-socket volumes, no proxy sidecar needed.
- `GcpServerlessVpcConnector` — only when an org constraint forbids
  direct VPC egress; otherwise skip the connector entirely.
- `GcpCloudRunJob` — the run-to-completion sibling for batch work; do
  not run batch inside a service with `cpuIdle: false`.
