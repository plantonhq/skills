# GcpCloudComposerUserWorkloadsSecret Guide

The judgment this guide protects: this is how credentials reach DAGs
without living in DAG code, environment variables, or the Airflow UI.
The Secret is managed as infrastructure — created, rotated, and
destroyed through IaC — while Composer materializes it as a Kubernetes
Secret in the environment's workloads namespace.

## Base64 is the contract, not a suggestion

Every `data` value must be base64-encoded
(`echo -n 'postgresql://...' | base64`) — the API rejects raw values,
and the spec validates the encoding pre-deploy. The comment trap:
`echo` WITHOUT `-n` encodes a trailing newline into the credential,
which then fails authentication at 2 a.m. with no visible difference
in the manifest.

## Rotation is a data edit, in place

`data` is the only mutable field — rotating a credential is a value
change and an apply; consumers pick it up on their next pod start or
connection re-read. Name, environment, region, and project are all
immutable: a rename is a new Secret plus a DAG reference update, so
name Secrets after their ROLE (`orders-db-credentials`), never their
current value or owner.

## Consumption happens by name, in Airflow's own terms

KubernetesPodOperator tasks mount or env-inject the Secret by its
`secretName`; Airflow connections read it through the secrets backend
convention (`connections/<name>` keys). The `secret_name` output is
the value downstream wiring should reference — chart compositions pass
it, never a re-typed literal.

## PREVENT protects pipelines, not data

The Secret's material exists in your secret source of truth; what a
destroy breaks is every DAG consuming it. `deletionPolicy: PREVENT`
fits Secrets live pipelines depend on — the destroy fails instead of
silently breaking the night's runs. `ABANDON` leaves the Kubernetes
Secret in the cluster for a management handover.

## What is deliberately absent

No `google_project_service` enablement — the Composer API is
necessarily already on in the environment's project (a Secret cannot
exist without an environment). The decoded material never appears in
stack outputs, and both engines hold the data as a state secret.
