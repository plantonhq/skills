GcpTargetHttpProxySpec defines a global Compute Engine target HTTP proxy —
the plaintext-HTTP frontend adapter of a global external Application Load
Balancer (and of Traffic Director meshes). A target HTTP proxy binds a
global forwarding rule (the VIP) to a URL map (the routing brain): the
forwarding rule delivers client connections to the proxy, and the proxy
consults the URL map to pick the backend service or bucket for each
request.

The proxy itself is deliberately thin — TLS termination lives on the
target HTTPS proxy, routing lives on the URL map, and traffic policy lives
on the backend service. The standard production pattern is a PAIR of
proxies sharing one frontend story: this HTTP proxy points at a
redirect-only URL map (http→https 301) while the HTTPS proxy serves the
real application.

The only mutable field is url_map (GCP updates it in place via a dedicated
setUrlMap call); everything else is immutable and forces
destroy-and-recreate.

## Example

```yaml
apiVersion: gcp.planton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: GcpTargetHttpProxy
metadata:
  name: my-sample-http-proxy
spec:
  # GCP project that owns the proxy.
  # Omit to use the provider's default project.
  projectId:
    value: my-gcp-project-123

  # Cloud-side name; omit to default to metadata.name.
  proxyName: web-http-frontend

  description: Port-80 frontend serving the http-to-https redirect URL map

  # The URL map the proxy routes through (reference a GcpUrlMap or provide a
  # self-link). The standard pattern points the HTTP proxy at a
  # redirect-only URL map while the HTTPS proxy serves the application.
  urlMap:
    value: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-gcp-project-123/global/urlMaps/http-redirect

  # Idle client keep-alive (EXTERNAL_MANAGED only); omit for GCP's default.
  httpKeepAliveTimeoutSec: 610

  # DELETE keeps destroys real; PREVENT belongs on production frontends.
  deletionPolicy: DELETE
```

## Field Details

### spec.projectId

`string | valueFrom`

The GCP project that owns the target HTTP proxy.
Can be a literal project ID or a reference to a GcpProject resource.
If omitted, the provider's default project is used.
Immutable: changing it destroys and recreates the proxy.

- references: GcpProject (`status.outputs.project_id`)
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: GcpProject, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.project_id}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.proxyName

`string`

Name of the proxy in GCP. Must be 1-63 characters: lowercase letters,
digits, and hyphens; must start with a letter and end with a letter or
digit. If not specified, defaults to metadata.name.
Immutable: changing it destroys and recreates the proxy, briefly
breaking every forwarding rule that references the old self_link.

- rule: proxy_name must be RFC1035-compliant: 1-63 lowercase letters, digits, or hyphens; must start with a letter and end with a letter or digit

### spec.description

`string`

What this proxy fronts and which forwarding rule points at it — write it
for the operator tracing a request path later. Immutable.

- rule: {"string":{"maxLen":"2048"}}

### spec.urlMap

`string | valueFrom` · required

The URL map that decides where each request goes — the proxy's single
routing dependency. Reference a GcpUrlMap resource or provide a URL map
self-link directly. Required. Mutable: GCP swaps it in place (a
dedicated setUrlMap call), so repointing a live frontend at a new
routing table causes no downtime.

- references: GcpUrlMap (`status.outputs.self_link`)
- rule: {"required":true}
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: GcpUrlMap, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.self_link}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.httpKeepAliveTimeoutSec

`int32`

Seconds an idle client connection is kept open after a response while no
matching traffic flows (5-1200). Only honored by load balancers with the
EXTERNAL_MANAGED scheme (the envoy-based global external ALB), where the
GCP default is 610; the classic EXTERNAL ALB ignores it. Raise it above
your clients' own keep-alive to avoid the load balancer closing
connections first. 0 means unset (GCP applies its default). Immutable:
changing it destroys and recreates the proxy.

- rule: http_keep_alive_timeout_sec must be between 5 and 1200 seconds (or 0 to let GCP apply its default)

### spec.proxyBind

`bool`

Bind the proxy to the private IPs of the Traffic Director mesh instead
of Google's edge. Only meaningful when the forwarding rule that
references this proxy uses the INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED scheme (Traffic
Director); leave false for internet-facing load balancers. Immutable.

### spec.deletionPolicy

`string`

Deletion policy for the proxy — what happens when this resource is
destroyed:
  ""        -- same as "DELETE" (provider default)
  "DELETE"  -- the proxy is deleted (GCP refuses while a forwarding
               rule still references it, so a frontend cannot be torn
               down out from under its VIP)
  "PREVENT" -- destroy FAILS; protects a production frontend from
               accidental teardown
  "ABANDON" -- the proxy is removed from management but keeps
               serving in GCP

- rule: deletion_policy must be one of: DELETE, PREVENT, ABANDON

## Outputs

Reference an output from another manifest as `valueFrom: {kind: GcpTargetHttpProxy, name: <resource-name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.<output>}`.

| Output | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `status.outputs.self_link` | `string` | Self-link URI of the target HTTP proxy. This is the value a global forwarding rule references as its target — the composition handle that puts a VIP in front of this proxy. Format: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/global/targetHttpProxies/{name} |
| `status.outputs.proxy_name` | `string` | Name of the proxy as it exists in GCP. |
| `status.outputs.proxy_id` | `string` | Server-assigned numeric ID of the proxy. |
| `status.outputs.fingerprint` | `string` | Server-computed fingerprint for optimistic concurrency control. |

## References
