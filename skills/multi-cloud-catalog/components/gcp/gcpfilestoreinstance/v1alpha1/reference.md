GcpFilestoreInstanceSpec defines the configuration for a Google Cloud
Filestore instance.

Filestore provides fully managed, high-performance NFS file storage for
applications that require a file system interface and shared access to data.
Common use cases include media rendering, EDA, genomics processing, web
serving, content management, and shared storage for GKE workloads.

Each instance contains exactly one file share that is mounted via NFS.
Instances are tied to a single VPC network and a single location (zone or
region depending on the tier).

Available tiers (in order of increasing capability):
  - BASIC_HDD / STANDARD: cost-effective HDD-backed storage
  - BASIC_SSD / PREMIUM: mid-tier SSD-backed storage
  - HIGH_SCALE_SSD: legacy high-performance SSD (being replaced by ZONAL)
  - ZONAL: modern single-zone SSD with performance tuning
  - REGIONAL: multi-zone SSD with high availability
  - ENTERPRISE: highest tier with regional HA and cross-region replication

Important behavioral notes:

  - The instance_name, location, tier, protocol, network configuration, and
    kms_key_name are immutable after creation. Changing them requires replacing
    the instance.

  - File share capacity can be increased after creation but not decreased.

  - NFS export options can be updated after creation.

GcpVpcNetwork reference resolves to it. Required by GCP for
instances using Private Service Connect (where client IPs are not
otherwise attributable to a network), optional for other connect
modes.

- references: GcpVpcNetwork (`status.outputs.network_name`)
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: GcpVpcNetwork, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.network_name}} -- a bare string does not parse

`string`

Restore this file share from an existing Filestore backup, in the
format projects/{project}/locations/{location}/backups/{backup}.
The share's capacity must be at least the backup's source capacity.
Create-time only.

### spec.fileShare.sourceBackupdrBackup

`string`

Restore this file share from a Backup and DR Service backup, in
the format projects/{project}/locations/{location}/
backupVaults/{vault}/dataSources/{source}/backups/{backup}.
The vault-based alternative to source_backup (which restores from
Filestore's own backups); set at most one restore source.
Create-time only.

### spec.networkConfig

`GcpFilestoreInstanceNetworkConfig` · required

VPC network configuration. Each Filestore instance connects to exactly one network.

- rule: {"required":true}
- rule: psc_endpoint_project is only meaningful when connect_mode is PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT

### spec.networkConfig.network

`string | valueFrom` · required

VPC network to which the Filestore instance is connected, as the
network NAME (e.g. "prod-vpc") — the Filestore API rejects self-link
URLs for same-project networks, so the reference resolves the
GcpVpcNetwork's plain name output.
Immutable after creation.

- references: GcpVpcNetwork (`status.outputs.network_name`)
- rule: {"required":true}
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: GcpVpcNetwork, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.network_name}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.networkConfig.reservedIpRange

`string`

If not specified, GCP automatically selects an unused range.
Immutable after creation.

### spec.networkConfig.modes

`[]string`

IP address versions the instance serves. Values: "MODE_IPV4",
"MODE_IPV6". When empty, ["MODE_IPV4"] is used — the standard NFS
posture. Immutable after creation.

- rule: {"repeated":{"maxItems":"2","unique":true,"items":{"string":{"in":["MODE_IPV4","MODE_IPV6"]}}}}

### spec.networkConfig.pscEndpointProject

`string | valueFrom`

Consumer project in which the Private Service Connect endpoint is
created — a project ID; a GcpProject reference resolves to it. If
omitted, the endpoint is created in the instance's own project.
Only meaningful when connect_mode is PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT
(enforced pre-deploy). Immutable after creation.

- references: GcpProject (`status.outputs.project_id`)
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: GcpProject, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.project_id}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.performanceConfig

`GcpFilestoreInstancePerformanceConfig`

Performance configuration for IOPS tuning.
Available on ZONAL, REGIONAL, and ENTERPRISE tiers.
If not specified, the instance uses the default performance for its tier.

- rule: fixed_iops and iops_per_tb are mutually exclusive; set only one

### spec.performanceConfig.fixedIops

### spec.performanceConfig.iopsPerTb.maxIopsPerTb

`int32` · required

Maximum IOPS per terabyte of capacity.

- rule: {"required":true,"int32":{"gte":1}}

### spec.initialReplication

`GcpFilestoreInstanceInitialReplication`

Cross-instance replication established at create time: this instance
becomes the STANDBY replica of an existing ACTIVE peer (the common
DR posture). Create-time only.

### spec.initialReplication.role

`string`

Replication role of THIS instance:
  ""        -- same as "STANDBY" (GCP default; this instance receives
               replication from the peer)
  "STANDBY" -- this instance is the read-only replica
  "ACTIVE"  -- this instance is the replication source

- rule: replication role must be ACTIVE or STANDBY

### spec.initialReplication.peerInstances

`[]string | valueFrom` · required

Peer Filestore instances in the replication relationship, each as a
reference to a GcpFilestoreInstance (or a literal full resource path
projects/{project}/locations/{location}/instances/{instance}).

- references: GcpFilestoreInstance (`status.outputs.instance_id`)
- rule: {"repeated":{"minItems":"1"}}
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: GcpFilestoreInstance, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.instance_id}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.labels

`map<string, string>`

User labels merged with Planton attribution labels (which win on key
conflicts). Keys and values must match GCP label constraints.

### spec.tags

`map<string, string>`

Resource Manager tags bound to the instance for org-policy and IAM
conditions. Keys in the form "tagKeys/{id}", values "tagValues/{id}".
Create-time only.

### spec.ldap

`GcpFilestoreInstanceLdapConfig`

LDAP directory integration for NFSv4.1 identity mapping. Requires
protocol NFS_V4_1 — with NFSv3, identity is numeric UID/GID
matching and no directory service applies.

### spec.ldap.domain

`string` · required

LDAP domain name, e.g. "my-domain.com".

- rule: {"required":true}

### spec.ldap.servers

`[]string` · required

LDAP server addresses — either all DNS names (e.g.
"ldap.example.com") or all IP addresses; GCP rejects a mix of the
two formats.

- rule: {"repeated":{"minItems":"1"}}

### spec.ldap.groupsOu

`string`

Groups Organizational Unit (OU) — an optional hint that narrows
LDAP lookups to one OU instead of querying the whole namespace
(faster lookups on large directories).

### spec.ldap.usersOu

`string`

Users Organizational Unit (OU) — the same lookup-narrowing hint
for user entries.

### spec.desiredReplicaState

`string` · optional (explicit presence)

Desired state of THIS instance's replica relationship, when the
instance is the STANDBY side of a replication pair:
  "READY"  (default) -- replication runs; the standby receives
                        changes from the active peer
  "PAUSED"           -- replication is paused (e.g. to freeze the
                        standby at a point in time); resume by
                        setting READY again
Updatable in place; has no effect on an instance without a
replica relationship.

- default: `READY`
- rule: desired_replica_state must be READY or PAUSED

### spec.deletionPolicy

`string`

Deletion policy for the instance — what happens when this resource
is destroyed (evaluated only after deletion_protection_enabled
allows the destroy at all):
  ""        -- same as "DELETE" (provider default)
  "DELETE"  -- the instance and every file on its share are deleted
  "PREVENT" -- destroy FAILS; a second, independent guard for a
               file server whose data exists nowhere else
  "ABANDON" -- the instance is removed from management but left
               running (and billing) in GCP with its data intact

- rule: deletion_policy must be one of: DELETE, PREVENT, ABANDON

## Validation Rules

- `ldap_requires_nfs_v4_1`: ldap requires protocol NFS_V4_1 — LDAP identity mapping is not available on NFSv3

## Outputs

Reference an output from another manifest as `valueFrom: {kind: GcpFilestoreInstance, name: <resource-name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.<output>}`.

| `status.outputs.create_time` | `string` | Timestamp when the instance was created (RFC3339 format). |
