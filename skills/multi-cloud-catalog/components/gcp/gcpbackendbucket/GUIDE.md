# GcpBackendBucket Guide

The judgment this guide protects: the backend bucket is deliberately a
separate node from the GCS bucket it serves — the indirection is what
makes static releases boring. Keep it thin, keep the origin swappable.

## The origin swap is the release mechanism

`bucketName` is the one REQUIRED field and it is deliberately MUTABLE:
pointing at a different bucket is an in-place update. That makes
blue/green static releases a one-field edit — upload the new build to a
fresh bucket, swap the origin, roll back by swapping again. Never deploy
by overwriting objects in the live bucket; the cache makes that path
unpredictable.

## CDN caching is a contract with your headers

`CACHE_ALL_STATIC` trusts content types; `USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS` trusts you;
`FORCE_CACHE_ALL` trusts nothing and caches everything — never point it
at a bucket with private or per-user content. When responses look stale
after a release, check `signedUrlCacheMaxAgeSec` and the negative-caching
codes before blaming the swap: cached 404s from the deploy window are the
usual culprit.

## Signed-URL key rotation is add-then-remove

GCP caps keys at 3 per bucket precisely so one can rotate while another
stays live: add the new key, re-sign URLs with it, then remove the old.
Each key is immutable — changing a `keyValue` replaces that key resource,
which is the rotation semantics signed URLs need. The key material is
secret in both engines' state; it never appears in outputs. Remember the
CDN also needs `roles/storage.objectViewer` on the origin bucket for
signed serving of private objects.

## Cloud CDN and INTERNAL_MANAGED do not mix

`loadBalancingScheme: INTERNAL_MANAGED` serves cross-region internal
ALBs and is incompatible with `enableCdn` — the spec rejects the
combination pre-deploy. The scheme is immutable; choosing it later is a
recreate, though with a stable URL map reference that is a quick swap.

## Teardown discipline

One `deletionPolicy` governs the backend bucket AND every signed-URL key
— they have no independent life. GCP refuses to delete a backend bucket
a URL map still references, so `DELETE` fails safely mid-chain; `PREVENT`
also covers the window after the URL map is gone. `ABANDON` leaves the
CDN origin serving unmanaged. The GCS bucket behind it is never touched —
it belongs to its own kind.
