# GcpComputeMig Guide

Operational judgment for running managed instance groups as code — the
things the spec reference cannot tell you.

## The template rotation is the deploy pipeline

Every `template` change rotates the template and — with `updatePolicy`
`PROACTIVE` — rolls the fleet. That makes this ONE resource your VM
deploy pipeline: bake an image, change `sourceImage`, apply, and the
group replaces instances within the surge/unavailability budget. Two
consequences worth internalizing: (1) size the budget for your traffic —
`maxSurgeFixed` above zero buys zero-unavailability rollouts at
temporary double-capacity cost; (2) `OPPORTUNISTIC` means an applied
change may sit unapplied for days on a stable fleet — pair it with
deliberate refresh operations, not with the expectation of convergence.
The `current_template_self_link` output changes on every rotation —
compare across applies to confirm a rollout actually rolled.

## RECREATE vs SUBSTITUTE is an identity decision

`SUBSTITUTE` (default) gives replaced instances fresh random names —
surge works, rollouts can be zero-downtime, and nothing downstream may
depend on instance names. `RECREATE` preserves names — what stateful
consumers and per-instance configs want — but the group must take
instances DOWN to replace them (the spec enforces the unavailability
budget above zero). Decide per workload, not per rollout: flipping the
method later churns the whole fleet's identity.

## Auto-healing thresholds are not LB thresholds

Wire a DEDICATED GcpHealthCheck into `autoHealing`, tuned conservative
(long interval, high unhealthy threshold), and let the load balancer's
own health check stay aggressive. Sharing one aggressive check turns a
slow garbage-collection pause into a repair storm: the LB should stop
ROUTING to a slow instance in seconds; the group should REPLACE it only
when it is genuinely gone. Size `initialDelaySec` to the real cold start
(app boot + warmup), not to the VM boot.

## Stateful groups are a set of one-way doors

`statefulDisks`, stateful IPs, and `perInstanceConfigs` change the
group's character: repairs preserve state, updates stop rebalancing
(regional groups want `instanceRedistributionType: NONE`), and the
autoscaler cannot scale IN safely below the configured instances. The
per-instance-config destroy knobs matter at teardown:
`removeInstanceOnDestroy` deletes the INSTANCE with its config;
`removeInstanceStateOnDestroy` strips just the state; the preserved
disks' `deleteRule` decides whether data survives permanent instance
deletion. Rehearse the teardown path before trusting it with data.

## Standby pools trade money for cold-start time

`standbyPolicy` mode `SCALE_OUT_POOL` with `targetSuspendedSize` keeps
pre-booted VMs suspended: scale-outs resume in seconds instead of
booting in minutes, while suspended VMs bill for disks and memory only.
The economics work when your scale-out latency SLO is tighter than a VM
boot and the workload's boot is expensive (large images, slow warmup) —
otherwise it is idle spend. Stopped standbys (`targetStoppedSize`) are
cheaper and slower; mixing both tiers is legal.

## Resize requests are asks, not guarantees

A `resizeRequests` entry queues a request for capacity (the Dynamic
Workload Scheduler path for scarce shapes — GPUs, large memory). It may
sit QUEUED indefinitely, and granted instances are RECLAIMED when
`requestedRunDurationSeconds` expires. Watch the request's state through
the API, and treat quota as the first suspect when nothing gets granted:
the ask counts against the same regional quota as ordinary instances.

## Quota is a fleet-multiplied problem

A rollout with surge, a standby pool, and an autoscaler burst can
demand `targetSize + surge + standby + burst` instances of quota
simultaneously — in ONE zone for zonal groups. Regional groups spread
the demand but require quota in EVERY zone the distribution policy
names. Check `compute.googleapis.com/cpus` and per-family quotas against
the worst case, not the steady state.

## Teardown discipline

`deletionPolicy: DELETE` (default) tears down the whole stack — VMs
terminate, per-VM disks follow their template `autoDelete`, stateful
disks follow their `deleteRule`, and an ACTIVE resize request is
cancelled. `ABANDON` leaves the fleet running unmanaged — the escape
hatch when handing a serving tier to another team's IaC. `PREVENT` fails
the destroy outright. One provider asymmetry recorded honestly: the
zonal instance TEMPLATE carries no deletion policy (it is always deleted
on destroy) — the regional one participates like every other resource.

## Coverage decisions on record

`workload_identity_config` (managed workload identity for the VMs) is GA
provider surface but not bridged by the pinned Pulumi SDK — recorded as
an SDK-gap exclusion in `iac/provider-parity.yaml`; it lands as spec
surface when the bridge ships it. CSEK raw-key encryption arms are
deliberately not modeled (raw key material does not belong in manifests
or state — use CMEK). Legacy preemptible-only VMs are not modeled: set
`scheduling.provisioningModel: SPOT` and both engines derive the legacy
flag the API still requires.
