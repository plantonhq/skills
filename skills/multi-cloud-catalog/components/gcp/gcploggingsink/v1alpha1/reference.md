GcpLoggingSinkSpec defines a Cloud Logging sink — the routing rule that
exports log entries matching a filter to a destination (a GCS bucket, a
BigQuery dataset, a Pub/Sub topic, or any other Logging-supported
destination URI).

One kind covers all four sink scopes. The `scope` message selects where
the sink lives — a project (the default; an empty scope uses the
provider's ambient project), a folder, an organization, or a billing
account — and the module creates the matching GCP resource
(google_logging_{project|folder|organization|billing_account}_sink).

THE post-create step every sink needs: GCP mints a `writer_identity`
service account for the sink, and that identity must be GRANTED write
access on the destination (e.g. roles/storage.objectCreator on the
bucket) or the sink silently exports nothing. The writer_identity stack
output exists exactly for that wiring — grant it through the destination
kind's iam_members in the same chart.

## Example

```yaml
apiVersion: gcp.planton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: GcpLoggingSink
metadata:
  name: my-sample-logging-sink
  # GcpGcsBucket is this kind's REGISTRY prerequisite — the harness deploys
  # the bucket fixture first and resolves the reference below; no
  # annotation needed.
spec:
  # Where the sink lives. Omit entirely for a project sink in the
  # provider's default project — the common case. (Folder, organization,
  # and billing-account scopes take folderId / organizationId /
  # billingAccount instead.)

  # The sink name; omit to default to metadata.name. Renaming recreates
  # the sink and mints a NEW writer identity — re-grant the destination.
  sinkName: my-sample-logging-sink

  # Where matching entries export — exactly one arm. The module renders
  # the service-scheme URI (storage.googleapis.com/...) so the manifest
  # references the resource naturally.
  destination:
    gcsBucket:
      valueFrom:
        kind: GcpGcsBucket
        # The bucket kind's PUBLISHED prerequisite fixture name.
        name: planton-oss-e2e-gcsb-prereq
        fieldPath: status.outputs.bucket_id

  # Which entries export. Empty exports EVERYTHING in scope — deliberate
  # for audit archives, expensive otherwise.
  filter: severity>=ERROR

  # Why this sink exists and where its data lands.
  description: Archives error-level logs for compliance review

  # Carve noisy sub-streams out of the export; sample() drops a
  # percentage of matches.
  exclusions:
    - name: drop-health-checks
      filter: httpRequest.requestUrl:"/healthz"
      description: Health-check noise is never evidence

  # Project scope only (default true; other scopes always mint a unique
  # writer). Required true for BigQuery destinations and cross-project
  # export.
  uniqueWriterIdentity: true

  # What a destroy does: DELETE (default), PREVENT, or ABANDON.
  # PREVENT is the honest posture for compliance-mandated exports.
  deletionPolicy: DELETE
```

## Field Details

### spec.scope

`GcpLoggingSinkScope`

Where the sink lives. Omit entirely for a project sink in the
provider's default project — the common case.

- rule: set at most one of project_id, folder_id, organization_id, or billing_account (empty means the provider's default project)

### spec.scope.projectId

`string | valueFrom`

Project sink: the owning project — a literal project ID or a reference
to a GcpProject resource.

- references: GcpProject (`status.outputs.project_id`)
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: GcpProject, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.project_id}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.scope.folderId

`string`

Folder sink: the folder ID (numeric, with or without the "folders/"
prefix).

### spec.scope.organizationId

`string`

Organization sink: the numeric organization ID.

### spec.scope.billingAccount

`string`

Billing-account sink: the billing account ID
(e.g. 012345-6789AB-CDEF01).

### spec.sinkName

`string`

The sink name in GCP. Defaults to metadata.name when left empty.
Immutable: changing it destroys and recreates the sink (a new
writer_identity is minted — re-grant destination access).

### spec.destination

`GcpLoggingSinkDestination` · required

Where matching log entries are exported. Exactly one destination arm.

- rule: {"required":true}
- rule: set exactly one destination: gcs_bucket, bigquery_dataset, pubsub_topic, or raw_uri
- rule: use_partitioned_tables applies only to a bigquery_dataset destination

### spec.destination.gcsBucket

`string | valueFrom`

Export to a Cloud Storage bucket (hourly batches of JSON files). The
bucket NAME — a literal or a reference to a GcpGcsBucket resource.
Rendered as storage.googleapis.com/{bucket}. Grant the sink's
writer_identity roles/storage.objectCreator on the bucket.

- references: GcpGcsBucket (`status.outputs.bucket_id`)
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: GcpGcsBucket, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.bucket_id}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.destination.bigqueryDataset

`string | valueFrom`

Export to a BigQuery dataset (near-real-time, queryable). Accepts the
dataset SELF LINK (https://bigquery.googleapis.com/bigquery/v2/projects/
{p}/datasets/{d} — the GcpBigQueryDataset self_link output) or a bare
projects/{p}/datasets/{d} path; the module normalizes either into the
bigquery.googleapis.com/... destination URI. Grant the writer_identity
roles/bigquery.dataEditor on the dataset. The reference is
containment-exempt: the sink EXPORTS INTO the dataset, it does not live
inside it (the sink's home is its scope).

- references: GcpBigQueryDataset (`status.outputs.self_link`)
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: GcpBigQueryDataset, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.self_link}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.destination.usePartitionedTables

`bool`

BigQuery destinations only: write into date-partitioned tables
(recommended — enables partition pruning and expiration) instead of
date-sharded table names. Requires unique_writer_identity true (the
provider's own constraint).

### spec.destination.pubsubTopic

`string | valueFrom`

Export to a Pub/Sub topic (streaming; the front door to third-party
log pipelines). The full topic path projects/{p}/topics/{t} — a literal
or a reference to a GcpPubSubTopic resource (its topic_id output).
Rendered as pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/{p}/topics/{t}. Grant the
writer_identity roles/pubsub.publisher on the topic.

- references: GcpPubSubTopic (`status.outputs.topic_id`)
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: GcpPubSubTopic, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.topic_id}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.destination.rawUri

`string`

Escape hatch: a complete destination URI passed through verbatim, for
destinations without a first-class arm — chiefly Cloud Logging buckets
(logging.googleapis.com/projects/{p}/locations/{l}/buckets/{b}) until a
dedicated log-bucket kind exists, and cross-project Logging API
destinations.

### spec.filter

`string`

The logs filter selecting entries to export
(https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/logging-query-language),
e.g. severity>=ERROR or resource.type="cloud_run_revision".
Empty exports EVERYTHING in scope — deliberate for audit archives,
expensive for anything else.

### spec.description

`string`

Why this sink exists and where its data lands — write it for the
operator auditing log routing later. At most 8000 characters.

- rule: {"string":{"maxLen":"8000"}}

### spec.disabled

`bool`

If true, the sink keeps its configuration but exports nothing — the
safe way to pause an export without losing the writer identity and
destination grants.

### spec.exclusions

`[]GcpLoggingSinkExclusion`

Log entries matching ANY of these exclusion filters are NOT exported,
even when they match `filter` — carve noisy sub-streams (health checks,
debug logs) out of a broad export.

- rule: {"repeated":{"maxItems":"50"}}

### spec.exclusions[].name

`string` · required

Identifier for this exclusion (letters, digits, underscores, hyphens,
periods; must start alphanumeric; at most 100 characters).

- rule: exclusion name must start with a letter or digit, use only letters, digits, underscores, hyphens, and periods, and be at most 100 characters
- rule: {"required":true}

### spec.exclusions[].filter

`string` · required

The logs filter selecting entries to EXCLUDE. Use the sample()
function to exclude only a percentage (e.g.
sample(insertId, 0.9) drops 90% of matches).

- rule: {"required":true}

### spec.exclusions[].description

`string`

What this exclusion carves out and why.

### spec.exclusions[].disabled

`bool`

If true, this exclusion is ignored (its entries export normally) —
stage or pause a carve-out without deleting it.

### spec.includeChildren

`bool`

Folder/organization scopes only: also export logs from all CHILD
resources (subfolders and projects). Off by default — the sink then
sees only logs at the scope itself.

### spec.interceptChildren

`bool`

Folder/organization scopes only (requires include_children semantics):
INTERCEPT matching logs — they are exported by this sink and NOT routed
onward to the children's own sinks. For centralized compliance capture;
use deliberately, it changes what child projects see.

### spec.uniqueWriterIdentity

`bool` · optional (explicit presence)

Project scope only. If true (default), GCP mints a dedicated service
account as the sink's writer identity — required for exporting across
projects and for BigQuery destinations. Setting false uses the legacy
shared cloud-logs@ account (single-project GCS/Pub/Sub only; not
recommended). Folder/organization/billing sinks always get a unique
writer. Both IaC engines send the value explicitly on project sinks so
behavior is identical regardless of engine.

- default: `true`

### spec.customWriterIdentity

`string`

Project scope only: use a caller-provided service account as the
writer identity instead of a GCP-minted one (format:
serviceAccount:{email} is NOT included — pass the bare email). Requires
unique_writer_identity true semantics; GCP rejects the combination
with false.

### spec.deletionPolicy

`string`

Deletion policy — what happens when this resource is destroyed:
  ""        -- same as "DELETE" (provider default)
  "DELETE"  -- the sink is deleted; export stops immediately (already
               exported data stays in the destination)
  "PREVENT" -- destroy FAILS; protects a compliance-mandated export
               pipeline from accidental teardown
  "ABANDON" -- the sink is removed from management but keeps exporting
               in GCP

- rule: deletion_policy must be one of: DELETE, PREVENT, ABANDON

## Validation Rules

- `children_flags_need_folder_or_org_scope`: include_children and intercept_children apply only to folder or organization scoped sinks
- `writer_identity_controls_are_project_scope_only`: unique_writer_identity=false and custom_writer_identity apply only to project-scoped sinks — other scopes always create a unique writer identity
- `bigquery_destination_requires_unique_writer`: a BigQuery destination requires unique_writer_identity to remain true

## Outputs

Reference an output from another manifest as `valueFrom: {kind: GcpLoggingSink, name: <resource-name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.<output>}`.

| Output | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `status.outputs.sink_name` | `string` | The sink name as it exists in GCP. |
| `status.outputs.writer_identity` | `string` | The service-account identity GCP minted (or adopted) for this sink — format "serviceAccount:{email}". THE chart output: grant this identity write access on the destination (roles/storage.objectCreator on a bucket, roles/bigquery.dataEditor on a dataset, roles/pubsub.publisher on a topic) via the destination kind's iam_members, or the sink silently exports nothing. |
