**apiVersion**: `azure.planton.dev/v1alpha1`

**AzureServiceBusSubscriptionSpec** defines the configuration for
creating a subscription under an Azure Service Bus topic: an independent,
optionally filtered view of the topic's message stream, with its own
consumer semantics (lock duration, delivery counts, sessions,
dead-lettering).

Subscriptions are many-per-topic and are typically owned by the
consuming team rather than the team that provisioned the namespace --
which is why they are a first-class kind referencing the topic.

**Filter rules fold inside the subscription** (the `rules` list): a
rule has no life outside its subscription and nothing references one.
Rules combine with OR semantics -- a message is delivered once if ANY
rule matches. Azure auto-creates a catch-all rule named `$Default`
(match everything) on every new subscription, so rules declared here
are ADDITIVE alongside it: the subscription keeps receiving everything
until the catch-all is removed. The management plane cannot remove or
overwrite a service-created rule declaratively (the providers refuse to
adopt an existing resource on create), so `$Default` is not a legal
declared name -- for restrictive delivery, remove the catch-all once
after creation:
`az servicebus topic subscription rule delete --name '$Default' ...`
(a one-time action; it never comes back unless the subscription is
recreated).

**ForceNew fields** (changing these replaces the subscription and
resets its read position): `subscription_name`, `requires_session`,
and the client_scoped_subscription block's identity fields.

## Field Details

### spec.topicId

`string | valueFrom` · required

The topic this subscription attaches to, by ARM ID. References an
AzureServiceBusTopic's topic_id output so the topic and its
subscriptions compose in one manifest set. Fixed at creation.

- references: AzureServiceBusTopic (`status.outputs.topic_id`)
- rule: {"required":true}
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: AzureServiceBusTopic, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.topic_id}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.subscriptionName

`string` · required

The subscription's name -- unique within the topic, up to 50
characters. Starts with a letter, number, or underscore; letters,
numbers, periods, hyphens, and underscores in between.

**ForceNew**: changing the name replaces the subscription and resets
its read position -- undelivered messages in the old subscription are
lost.

- rule: subscription_name must be up to 50 characters of letters, numbers, periods, hyphens, and underscores, starting and ending with a letter, number, or underscore
- rule: {"required":true,"string":{"minLen":"1","maxLen":"50"}}

### spec.maxDeliveryCount

`int32` · required

How many delivery attempts a message gets before it is moved to the
subscription's dead-letter sub-queue. Minimum 1. Lower values
quarantine poison messages faster; higher values ride out transient
consumer failures. Azure has no server default here -- the
subscription's tolerance for redelivery is an explicit choice (10 is
the queue-side convention).

- rule: {"required":true,"int32":{"gte":1}}

### spec.lockDuration

`string` · optional (explicit presence)

How long a received message stays locked in PeekLock mode before it
returns to the subscription for redelivery, as an ISO 8601 duration.
Range PT5S to PT5M. Azure's default: PT1M. Size it to the consumer's
processing time (SDKs can renew locks).

### spec.defaultMessageTtl

`string` · optional (explicit presence)

Default time-to-live for messages in this subscription, as an ISO
8601 duration. May be shorter than the topic's TTL (the shorter one
wins), never effectively longer. Unset inherits the topic's TTL.

### spec.autoDeleteOnIdle

`string` · optional (explicit presence)

Whether the subscription is automatically deleted after sitting idle
for this ISO 8601 duration. Minimum PT5M. Unset means never
auto-delete. Auto-delete suits ephemeral per-instance subscriptions
(each consumer instance materializes its own view and cleans up after
itself).

### spec.deadLetteringOnMessageExpiration

`bool` · optional (explicit presence)

Whether messages that expire (exceed their TTL) are moved to the
subscription's dead-letter sub-queue instead of being silently
deleted.
Default: false

### spec.deadLetteringOnFilterEvaluationError

`bool` · optional (explicit presence)

Whether messages that FAIL filter evaluation (a SQL filter that
throws on a malformed message) are dead-lettered instead of dropped.
Azure's default is true -- keep it unless noisy malformed producers
flood the dead-letter sub-queue.
Default: true

- default: `true`

### spec.requiresSession

`bool` · optional (explicit presence)

Whether sessions are enabled. Session-aware subscriptions deliver
each session's messages in strict order to one consumer at a time,
with broker-stored session state. Pair with the topic's
support_ordering for ordered publish-subscribe.

**ForceNew**: fixed at creation.
Default: false

### spec.batchedOperationsEnabled

`bool` · optional (explicit presence)

Whether clients may batch multiple operations into one broker call
for higher throughput.
Default: false (Azure's subscription-side default)

### spec.forwardTo

`string | valueFrom`

Auto-forward every message arriving in this subscription to another
queue or topic in the SAME namespace, by entity name (not ARM ID) --
the fan-out-then-collect routing primitive: subscriptions filter,
forwarding funnels the matches into a work queue. Reference the
target's queue_name or topic_name output (no default kind: either
entity type is a legal target), or pass a literal name. The target
must exist before the subscription.

- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: <Kind>, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.<output>}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.forwardDeadLetteredMessagesTo

`string | valueFrom`

Auto-forward dead-lettered messages to another queue or topic in the
same namespace, by entity name -- centralize poison-message handling.
Reference the target's queue_name or topic_name output, or pass a
literal name.

- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: <Kind>, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.<output>}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.status

`enum`

The subscription's gate state: ACTIVE (normal), DISABLED (delivery
and new arrivals stopped), or RECEIVE_DISABLED (arrivals accumulate,
delivery paused). Unspecified deploys ACTIVE.

- rule: {"enum":{"definedOnly":true}}

Allowed values (use exactly as shown):

- `azure_service_bus_subscription_status_unspecified` -- Not specified -- deploys ACTIVE.
- `ACTIVE` -- Normal operation: matched messages arrive and are delivered.
- `DISABLED` -- Delivery and new arrivals are stopped; stored messages are retained.
- `RECEIVE_DISABLED` -- Matched messages keep accumulating but delivery is paused -- buffer while consumers are offline.

### spec.clientScopedSubscription

`AzureServiceBusClientScopedSubscription`

Client-scoped (client-affine) subscription -- the JMS 2.0 shared/
unshared durable-subscription model, where the subscription is bound
to a specific client ID. Leave unset for the normal shared
subscription every Service Bus consumer uses.

### spec.clientScopedSubscription.clientId

`string`

The client ID the subscription is scoped to. Azure stores the entity
as `{name}$${client_id}$$D` internally; the modules and outputs keep
the user-facing name. **ForceNew**: fixed at creation.

### spec.clientScopedSubscription.shareable

`bool` · optional (explicit presence)

Whether multiple clients presenting the same client ID may consume
concurrently (JMS "shared" vs "unshared" durable subscription).
Azure's default is true. **ForceNew**: fixed at creation.

### spec.rules

`[]AzureServiceBusSubscriptionRule`

The subscription's filter rules. Each rule admits messages by SQL
expression or by correlation matching; rules combine with OR
semantics ALONGSIDE Azure's auto-created `$Default` catch-all (see
the message comment for the one-time catch-all removal that makes
declared filters restrictive). An empty list keeps just the
catch-all (deliver everything).

- rule: sql_filter is required with filter_type SQL_FILTER and must be absent with CORRELATION_FILTER
- rule: correlation_filter is required with filter_type CORRELATION_FILTER and must be absent with SQL_FILTER

### spec.rules[].ruleName

`string` · required

The rule's name -- unique within the subscription, up to 50
characters. `$Default` is reserved: Azure creates that catch-all
rule itself, and an existing service-created resource cannot be
adopted by a declared one (the providers' import check refuses it).

- rule: $Default is the service-created catch-all rule and cannot be declared -- name the rule for what it admits, and remove the catch-all once out-of-band for restrictive delivery (az servicebus topic subscription rule delete --name '$Default')
- rule: {"required":true,"string":{"minLen":"1","maxLen":"50"}}

### spec.rules[].filterType

`enum`

How this rule matches messages: SQL_FILTER (a SQL-92-like expression
over system and user properties -- flexible, evaluated per message)
or CORRELATION_FILTER (equality matching on correlation properties --
cheaper at high throughput).

- rule: {"enum":{"definedOnly":true,"notIn":[0]}}

Allowed values (use exactly as shown):

- `azure_service_bus_filter_type_unspecified` -- Not specified -- invalid; choose SQL_FILTER or CORRELATION_FILTER.
- `SQL_FILTER` -- A SQL-92-like expression over system (sys.*) and user properties. Flexible; evaluated per message.
- `CORRELATION_FILTER` -- Equality matching on correlation properties -- cheaper than SQL at high throughput.

### spec.rules[].sqlFilter

`string` · required · optional (explicit presence)

The SQL filter expression, e.g. "sys.Label = 'important' AND
quantity > 10". Required with (and only valid with) SQL_FILTER. Max
1024 characters.

- rule: {"string":{"minLen":"1","maxLen":"1024"}}

### spec.rules[].correlationFilter

`AzureServiceBusCorrelationFilter`

The correlation matcher. Required with (and only valid with)
CORRELATION_FILTER.

- rule: a correlation filter needs at least one matcher -- set correlation_id, message_id, to, reply_to, label, session_id, reply_to_session_id, content_type, or a properties entry

### spec.rules[].correlationFilter.correlationId

`string` · required · optional (explicit presence)

Match the message's CorrelationId.

- rule: {"string":{"minLen":"1"}}

### spec.rules[].correlationFilter.messageId

`string` · required · optional (explicit presence)

Match the message's MessageId.

- rule: {"string":{"minLen":"1"}}

### spec.rules[].correlationFilter.to

`string` · required · optional (explicit presence)

Match the message's To address.

- rule: {"string":{"minLen":"1"}}

### spec.rules[].correlationFilter.replyTo

`string` · required · optional (explicit presence)

Match the message's ReplyTo address.

- rule: {"string":{"minLen":"1"}}

### spec.rules[].correlationFilter.label

`string` · required · optional (explicit presence)

Match the message's Label (Subject).

- rule: {"string":{"minLen":"1"}}

### spec.rules[].correlationFilter.sessionId

`string` · required · optional (explicit presence)

Match the message's SessionId.

- rule: {"string":{"minLen":"1"}}

### spec.rules[].correlationFilter.replyToSessionId

`string` · required · optional (explicit presence)

Match the message's ReplyToSessionId.

- rule: {"string":{"minLen":"1"}}

### spec.rules[].correlationFilter.contentType

`string` · required · optional (explicit presence)

Match the message's ContentType.

- rule: {"string":{"minLen":"1"}}

### spec.rules[].correlationFilter.properties

`map<string, string>`

Match user-defined message properties by exact key/value equality.

### spec.rules[].action

`string` · required · optional (explicit presence)

An optional SQL action that annotates matched messages (SET
sys.Label = 'processed', SET priority = 'high') before delivery --
routing metadata without touching the producer.

- rule: {"string":{"minLen":"1"}}

## Outputs
