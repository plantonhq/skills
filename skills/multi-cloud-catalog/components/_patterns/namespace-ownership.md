# Namespace Ownership: Dedicated Component vs the createNamespace Flag

Most Kubernetes workload kinds carry a `createNamespace` convenience flag, and
composing several of them into one namespace with that flag set is the single
most common way agent-composed architectures fail on their second deploy. This
pattern is the judgment call: who owns the namespace.

## The problem

Kubernetes workload kinds (KubernetesPostgres, KubernetesValkey, and their
siblings) declare their target namespace the same way: a required
`spec.namespace` reference, plus a `createNamespace` boolean. When the flag is
true, the component's IaC module creates the namespace as its OWN resource:
it enters that component's state, and — as the spec documents — it is
**deleted with the resource**.

Two consequences follow, both invisible at validation time and painful at
deploy time:

1. **The second creator fails.** Deploy `orders-db` and `orders-cache` into
   the same namespace, both with `createNamespace: true`: the first deploy
   creates and owns the namespace; the second fails, because its module
   issues a plain create for a namespace that now already exists.
2. **The owner's teardown takes the neighborhood down.** Destroying the
   component that owns the namespace deletes the namespace — and everything
   every other component deployed into it.

## The composition

Give the namespace one owner: a dedicated KubernetesNamespace component.
Every workload references it and leaves `createNamespace` unset. The
`spec.namespace` field on workload kinds is a foreign key whose default
target is exactly this kind — the wiring below is what the schema itself
steers toward.

```yaml
apiVersion: kubernetes.planton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KubernetesNamespace
metadata:
  name: team-data
spec:
  name: team-data
  resourceProfile:
    preset: medium
  podSecurityStandard: baseline
```

```yaml
apiVersion: kubernetes.planton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KubernetesPostgres
metadata:
  name: orders-db
spec:
  namespace:
    valueFrom:
      kind: KubernetesNamespace
      name: team-data
      fieldPath: spec.name
  instances: 2
  storage:
    size: 10Gi
```

```yaml
apiVersion: kubernetes.planton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KubernetesValkey
metadata:
  name: orders-cache
spec:
  namespace:
    valueFrom:
      kind: KubernetesNamespace
      name: team-data
      fieldPath: spec.name
```

Deploy order follows the reference: the namespace component first, then the
workloads in any order. Adding a third workload later is a reference, not a
race.

## Choices and consequences

| Choice | What it buys | What it costs / risks |
|---|---|---|
| Dedicated KubernetesNamespace + references | One owner in one state; teardown of any workload never deletes the namespace; the namespace's own surface opens up (resource quotas, default-deny network policies, pod security standards, service-mesh injection); **renders as a visible node on the architecture diagram** with reference edges from each workload | One more component to declare |
| `createNamespace: true` on a single workload | One less manifest for a genuinely single-tenant namespace | The workload owns the namespace: destroying it deletes the namespace; a second component with the flag fails on already-exists; namespace stays bare (no quotas, no network policies — nothing beyond the standard governance labels the module applies); **invisible on the diagram** — the namespace exists in the cluster but appears nowhere in the architecture |
| `createNamespace: true` on several components sharing a namespace | Nothing | The failure in "The problem" — first deploy wins, second fails |

The diagram consequence deserves weight when composing for a user:
architectures on this platform render as resource graphs, and a dedicated
namespace component is part of the picture a user sees and reasons about. A
flag is not.

## When not to use this

A genuinely single-tenant namespace — one component, nothing else ever
planned in it, no quota/network/security requirements on the namespace
itself — is exactly what `createNamespace: true` is for. One manifest,
correct ownership (the component IS the only tenant), one fewer moving part.
Use the dedicated component the moment a second tenant appears or the
namespace itself needs configuration.

The canonical instances of this case are the cluster's shared
infrastructure components — an ingress controller in "ingress-nginx",
cert-manager in "cert-manager", ExternalDNS, a shared-chart operator in a
namespace of its own. Each conventionally owns a dedicated namespace no
other tenant will ever join, so the flag is the NORMAL shape there, not a
violation of this pattern.
