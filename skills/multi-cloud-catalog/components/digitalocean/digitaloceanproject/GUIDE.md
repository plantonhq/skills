# DigitalOcean Project -- Operational Guide

What experience with this component teaches that the field reference cannot.

## Destroy relocates -- plan for where things land

Deleting a project never deletes its contents: DigitalOcean requires the project to be empty, so everything inside is moved to the account's DEFAULT project first, then the empty project is deleted (with retries while the asynchronous moves settle). If you tear down a project as part of an environment teardown, destroy the member resources first -- otherwise they keep running, and billing, from the default project.

## One project per resource

A resource belongs to exactly one project. Declaring it in this project's `resources` list MOVES it -- including out of another project that also claims it. Two projects listing the same resource will fight forever. Give each resource one home, and prefer wiring membership by reference (`valueFrom` on the producing kind's `urn` output) so the graph is visible in code.

## Leave membership unmanaged when another system owns it

An empty `resources` list means "do not manage membership": resources assigned from the console or by their own project fields are left alone. Use this when teams assign resources to projects manually and the manifest should only own the container.

## The purpose field round-trips -- with one trap

Any free-text purpose works: DigitalOcean stores it as `Other: <your text>` and strips the prefix when reading back, so manifests converge. The one value that can never converge is text that itself starts with `Other:` -- the API would double-prefix it -- and validation rejects it up front.

## is_default: almost always leave it alone

DigitalOcean documents that a Terraform-managed project should not be made the account's default, and its own acceptance test expects a never-settling plan when it is. The account can have only ONE default, so out-of-band changes show up here as drift, and a default project refuses deletion. Set it only if the account's default is genuinely meant to be managed as code, and expect the quirks.

## Environment casing

Declare `environment` lowercase (`production`); DigitalOcean reports it back capitalized (`Production`). The provisioners absorb the difference -- do not "fix" it by writing the capitalized form, which validation rejects to keep one canonical spelling.

## What is deliberately NOT here

DigitalOcean's standalone partial-ownership membership resource (`digitalocean_project_resources`) -- it conflicts by design with the project's own whole-list membership read-back; team member permissions (account-level, not a project property); and any per-member configuration, which belongs to each member's own kind.
