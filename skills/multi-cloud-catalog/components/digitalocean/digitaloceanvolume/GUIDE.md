# DigitalOcean Volume -- Operational Guide

Judgment calls that matter when you run block storage on DigitalOcean.

## Size is a one-way ratchet

Volumes only expand. A manifest that lowers `sizeGib` fails at plan time — by design, since DigitalOcean has no shrink operation. Growing the volume is safe and online, but the filesystem inside does not grow itself: after an expansion, resize the filesystem from the Droplet (`resize2fs` for ext4, `xfs_growfs` for xfs). Budget sizes with headroom; "grow later" is easy, "grow now under pressure" is an incident.

## Format at creation or format yourself — never both

`filesystemType` formats the volume exactly once, at creation. DigitalOcean never reports the setting back, and changing it later replaces the volume (destroying the data). If you leave it unset, the volume arrives raw and you own `mkfs` from the Droplet. Pick one path per volume and stay on it: a volume formatted by hand but declared `ext4` later in the manifest will plan a replacement.

## The label is for mount automation

`initialFilesystemLabel` exists so cloud-init and fstab entries can mount by label (`LABEL=pgdata`) instead of by device path, which shifts across reboots and attach order. If you format at creation, set the label too — retrofitting one later means re-formatting or hand-running `e2label`/`xfs_admin` on the Droplet.

## Description is not editable — yet

The provider marks `description` create-only ("update-ability coming soon" in its own schema), so editing it in the manifest plans a full volume replacement. The plan will say so honestly — read plans on volume changes carefully before approving; a replaced data volume is data loss unless you snapshot first.

## Snapshots restore into new volumes, not in place

`snapshotId` seeds a NEW volume from a point-in-time capture — there is no in-place restore. The new volume inherits the snapshot's region and minimum size. Snapshots also outlive their source volume: deleting a volume does not delete its snapshots, which keep billing until removed (`doctl compute snapshot list`).

## Attachment lives on the Droplet

This kind creates storage; the Droplet's `volumeIds` list attaches it. That split is deliberate — the volume's lifecycle (usually long) stays independent of any one Droplet's lifecycle (often short). Move a volume between Droplets by editing the Droplets' manifests, never by recreating the volume. Both must be in the same region.
