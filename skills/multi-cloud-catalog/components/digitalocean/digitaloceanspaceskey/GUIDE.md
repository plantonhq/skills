# DigitalOcean Spaces Key -- Operational Guide

What experience with this component teaches that the field reference cannot.

## The secret is shown once -- design your handoff around that

`secret_key` exists in exactly one place: the create response. DigitalOcean never returns it again, from any API, ever. Both provisioners store it as a sensitive output, and consumers should read it from there (or through a reference) rather than expecting to look it up later. If the secret is lost, there is no recovery -- destroy the key and create a new one.

## Rotation means a new key, and consumers must follow

The key material is immutable: rotating credentials is destroy-and-recreate, which changes BOTH the access key and the secret. Plan rotation as a two-step move -- create the replacement key first, re-point every consumer, then destroy the old one. Deleting a key invalidates it immediately; anything still signing with it starts failing on the spot.

## Prefer per-bucket grants; treat fullaccess as an admin credential

A `fullaccess` grant covers every bucket in the account -- including buckets created after the key. That is occasionally right (a backup operator, an admin tool) and usually wrong for workloads. The per-bucket `read` / `readwrite` grants exist precisely so each workload's key unlocks only its own data. A key with NO grants is valid and authorizes nothing -- a safe placeholder state.

## The permission wall here is the only one anywhere

The provider performs no validation on `permission`: a typo like `write` upstream becomes an EMPTY permission, producing a grant that silently authorizes nothing -- the failure appears as mysterious 403s at the workload, far from the cause. This spec rejects anything outside `read` / `readwrite` / `fullaccess` at validation time, so the class never reaches DigitalOcean.

## Grant updates replace the whole list

Updating grants sends the complete list in one call -- there is no add-one-grant API. That is invisible in normal declarative use (the spec IS the whole list), but worth knowing when diagnosing: a grant you removed from the spec is genuinely revoked on the next apply, not left behind.

## What is deliberately NOT here

Import (the resource has no upstream importer, and the write-once secret could never round-trip -- recorded exclusion in the import map); a `created_at` output (a timestamp with no operational consumer); and any Spaces credential requirement for MANAGING keys -- key management rides the account API token; the key this component creates is itself the Spaces credential.
