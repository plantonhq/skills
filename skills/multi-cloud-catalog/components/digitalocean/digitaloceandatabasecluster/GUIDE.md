# DigitalOcean Database Cluster -- Operational Guide

Judgment calls that matter when you run managed databases on DigitalOcean.

## Pick the engine slug, not the marketing name

The `engine` values are DigitalOcean's own API slugs: PostgreSQL is `pg`, never `postgres`. Redis and Valkey are two slugs for one caching product line, and DigitalOcean has finished the move: a new cluster with `engine: redis` is rejected at the API (measured 2026-09-16 — the error reads `region 'nyc3' is not valid`, DigitalOcean's way of saying the engine is offered in no region). Keep `redis` only for adopting a cluster that already exists; every new cache is `valkey`.

## The version must be one DigitalOcean offers today

`engineVersion` is checked against DigitalOcean's live offer list, not against a format. `GET /v2/databases/options` names the versions per engine, and a value not on it fails at create with `422 invalid cluster engine version` — a bare `"8"` for MySQL fails today because the only MySQL line offered is `"8.4"`. The list moves: PostgreSQL 15 leaves the offer in May 2027, and majors retire on a schedule DigitalOcean publishes in the same response. When a deploy fails with that error, read the options endpoint and raise the version; the presets in this component name the version they were verified against and the date.

## "cluster name is not available" means more than one thing

Cluster names are unique per account, and a real duplicate is refused with `422 cluster name is not available`. On 2026-09-16 DigitalOcean answered with the same text for a brand-new name whenever the create's combined tags were too long, and any create in the few minutes after such a failure answered it too, tagged or not — a failed create could also leave a ghost cluster that answered 404, was missing from the list, and still counted as a member of its VPC. By 2026-09-17 the API named the real reason plainly (`422 combined tags cannot exceed 255 characters`, see the next section), a validation-class refusal that creates nothing and poisons nothing. If you still see "name is not available" on a name you know is free: wait a few minutes, then retry once before changing anything, and when a VPC later refuses to delete, look at `GET /v2/vpcs/{id}/members` for a `do:dbaas:` URN with an empty name.

## Combined tags are capped at 255 characters — and the Planton labels count

DigitalOcean caps a database cluster's tags as one comma-joined string of at most 255 characters (measured 2026-09-17: 255 passes, 256 fails with `422 combined tags cannot exceed 255 characters`; colons count as one character; the number of tags matters only through the commas between them). Both provisioners always add six Planton label tags — `planton-ai_resource:true`, `planton-ai_name:<metadata.name>`, `planton-ai_kind:DigitalOceanDatabaseCluster`, `planton-ai_organization:<org>`, `planton-ai_environment:<env>`, `planton-ai_id:<metadata.id>` — which cost about 133 characters plus the length of `metadata.name` and `metadata.id`, so a 40-character name with a short id leaves roughly 60 characters for your own `spec.tags`, and a 60-character name leaves none. Both provisioners check the budget before creating anything and fail with the exact arithmetic ("this cluster's 7 tags join to 267 characters"); the fix is a shorter `metadata.name`, a shorter `metadata.id`, or fewer `spec.tags`. Tags read back exactly as sent, so nothing else changes on a later apply.

## Every cluster comes with three alert policies you did not declare

When a cluster reaches `online`, DigitalOcean creates three monitoring alert policies for it — CPU, memory, and disk utilization above 90% over five minutes, emailing a team member — and they are not part of this resource: neither engine manages them, and deleting the cluster leaves them behind, still pointing at the deleted cluster's UUID. Expect them in `GET /v2/monitoring/alerts` (type `v1/dbaas/alerts/...`) and delete the ones whose cluster is gone; a DigitalOceanMonitorAlert manifest is the way to own the alerting you actually want.

## Node count is an engine decision

- **PostgreSQL / MySQL / MongoDB**: 1 node for dev, 3 for production failover. 2 buys a standby without quorum; most teams go straight to 3.
- **Redis / Valkey**: 1 node is normal — caches tolerate a failover gap. Add standbys only when cache warm-up is expensive.
- **Kafka**: 3 is the floor; DigitalOcean rejects less.
- **OpenSearch**: 1–15; go multi-node when the index must survive node loss rather than for query speed.

DigitalOcean enforces these server-side; the spec only enforces the universal minimum of 1 so new engine rules never require a contract change.

## Storage: plan for growth, not shrinkage

`storageGib` only ever grows. Two practical rules:

- Prefer `storageAutoscale` over hand-managed increments — DigitalOcean grows the disk at your threshold with a one-hour cooldown.
- If you grow `sizeSlug` while `storageGib` is unset, the cluster adopts the new slug's (larger) default storage automatically. A stale explicit `storageGib` smaller than the new slug's default is invalid — unset it when upsizing.

`storageAutoscale` deploys on both provisioners. Two facts DigitalOcean enforces that the field comments cannot fully carry: the API refuses an `incrementGib` larger than the size slug's maximum plan storage at create time (30 GiB on `db-s-1vcpu-1gb` — a 50 GiB step on that slug fails with `422 storage autoscale increment 50 must not be greater than maximum plan size 30`), so size the step for the smallest slug the manifest may run on; and the cluster's own API body never reports the autoscale settings (`storage_autoscale` is always `null` there) — they live at `GET /v2/databases/{id}/autoscale`, which both provisioners read, so a refreshed plan stays clean.

## Upgrades are one-way and live

Raising `engineVersion` performs an in-place major upgrade on the running cluster. There is no downgrade, and no blue-green: take a backup-restore copy first if the application's compatibility is unproven. Region changes are similar — a live migration, not a recreate — expect elevated latency while it runs.

## VPC placement is create-only

`vpc` cannot be changed after the cluster exists. Decide network placement first; retrofitting means a new cluster plus a data migration (`backupRestore` gives you the copy).

## Restoring from backup

`backupRestore.databaseName` names the SOURCE cluster; omit `backupCreatedAt` to take the newest backup. The block acts only at creation and is never reported back by DigitalOcean — it is provisioning input, not ongoing configuration.

## Connection strings: public vs private

`connection_uri`/`host` traverse the public internet (TLS-required); `private_uri`/`private_host` resolve only inside the cluster's VPC. Applications in the same VPC should always use the private pair — lower latency and no public exposure. The default user's password is in both URIs; treat them as secrets.

## Eviction policy semantics

`evictionPolicy` values mirror Redis maxmemory policies with underscores (`allkeys_lru`, `volatile_ttl`, ...). Removing the field from a cluster that had one resets the policy to `noeviction` — it does not "keep the last value".

## What is deliberately NOT here

Users, logical databases, connection pools, read replicas, firewall (trusted-sources) rules, per-engine config parameters, Kafka topics, and log sinks are separate DigitalOcean resources with independent lifecycles. Manage them as their own resources rather than expecting cluster fields.
