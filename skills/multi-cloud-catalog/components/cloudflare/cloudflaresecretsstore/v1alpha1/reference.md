CloudflareSecretsStoreSpec creates the account-level Secrets Store: the
vault that holds secrets consumed by Workers bindings, AI Gateway
authentication, and other Cloudflare surfaces. The store itself is just a
named container -- the secrets inside it are managed by
CloudflareSecretsStoreSecret resources referencing this store.

Two hard provider facts shape how this resource behaves:
  - EVERY field is create-only: changing the name (or account) replaces
    the store, destroying every secret inside it. Treat the store as
    permanent infrastructure and name it accordingly.
  - Cloudflare currently allows ONE store per account ("default"-style
    deployments): creating a second store fails at the API. If the
    account already has a store (e.g. created from the dashboard), adopt
    it by import instead of creating a new one.

## Example

```yaml
# Complete example manifest for CloudflareSecretsStore. Creates the
# account-level Secrets Store -- the vault Worker bindings and AI Gateway
# authentication consume secrets from. Both fields are create-only, and
# Cloudflare allows one store per account: adopt an existing store by import
# instead of creating a second.
