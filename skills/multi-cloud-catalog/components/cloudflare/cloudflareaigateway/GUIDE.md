# CloudflareAiGateway guide

The judgment this guide protects you from: the slug is the URL every client calls, route graphs replace rather than update, and one leaked provider default can silently collapse your spend budgets.

## Known upstream blocker: Terraform plans never settle (v5.23.0-v5.24.0)

Measured live 2026-08-27: the Cloudflare API is WRITE-ONLY for `guardrails`, `spend_limits`, `otel`, and a dynamic route's graph -- it accepts them on create/update but no read ever returns them (a route's graph comes back only under a `version.data` path the provider never consults). The provider still refreshes all of them, with two consequences on Terraform/OpenTofu at v5.23.0-v5.24.0:

- **Every gateway re-plans forever** -- even one that sets none of these fields (the provider models `otel`/`spend_limits` as computed and re-marks them "known after apply" on every plan). Applies succeed and are no-ops at Cloudflare; plan-gated pipelines see a permanent diff. No configuration shape avoids it, and `ignore_changes` cannot suppress a provider-planned unknown.
- **A Terraform-managed dynamic route is destroyed and recreated on every apply** (the un-restorable `elements` list forces replacement). Requests re-resolve by route name, but treat this as unusable for production routes.

Pulumi is unaffected (previews do not refresh) -- all Pulumi lifecycles verified clean against the live API. Until a provider release fixes the reads, manage gateways carrying these surfaces through Pulumi, or accept the permanent diff and per-apply route churn knowingly.

## Model nodes: fallback, timeout, and retries are required

Cloudflare rejects a route's `model` node without an `outputs.fallback` edge, `properties.timeout`, and `properties.retries` -- 400 code 7001 "Required" (the provider schema wrongly calls all three optional). Point `fallback` at the element to try when the model call fails; use the end node when there is no backup model.

## The gateway id IS the endpoint URL

`gateway_id` appears verbatim in the endpoint every client calls (`https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/<account>/<gateway_id>/...`). It is create-only: renaming replaces the gateway AND breaks every client mid-flight. Choose the slug like a domain name -- boring, stable, forever.

## Route graphs replace, never update

A dynamic route's `elements` list is create-only at the provider: ANY edit to the graph -- one condition, one model swap -- plans a replacement of that route object. This is safe (requests re-resolve the route by name on the next call) but worth knowing when you read the plan: a replace on a route is the designed behavior, not a mistake. Renaming a route is its only in-place update -- and the provider has a decode defect there (computed fields go stale in state until the next refresh), so prefer stable route names too.

## Every spend-limit rule needs its own id -- here is why the spec forces it

The provider schema ships a LEAKED EXAMPLE VALUE as the default rule id: every rule authored without an id gets the same identity and Cloudflare silently collapses them into one budget. This spec makes `id` required and unique per rule, so the failure cannot be authored. Pick short stable slugs ("daily-cap", "monthly-cap") -- they are identities, not descriptions.

## Guardrails: both sides, uppercase wire codes

`guardrails` requires BOTH `prompt` and `response` objects (an empty object means "evaluate nothing on this side"). Each control names a hazard-category code from Cloudflare's Guardrails taxonomy (p1, s1-s13 -- the Cloudflare docs carry what each code covers) and takes FLAG (log) or BLOCK (refuse). On the wire the codes are uppercase; the modules handle the casing -- author lowercase per the spec.

## Two credentials the provider forgot to mark

`otel[].authorization` and `stripe.authorization` are credentials the provider leaves unmarked. This spec treats both as sensitive: provide managed-secret references, and the modules keep them secret in state. Never paste a bearer token or Stripe key as a literal.

## ZDR and logging pull in opposite directions

`zdr: true` (Zero Data Retention) tells Cloudflare to never store request/response bodies; `collect_logs`, `logpush`, and log management all exist to store or ship exactly that data. Cloudflare enforces the legal combinations server-side -- expect API rejections, not plan errors, when you ask for both. Decide the data posture first, then configure logging around it.

## The five required scalars are required on purpose

Cloudflare demands an explicit choice for caching, log collection, and rate limiting -- there are no server defaults. A "minimal" gateway still states all five. `cache_ttl: 0` and `rate_limiting_interval: 0` are the explicit OFF switches.

## Pairs well with

- [CloudflareSecretsStore](../cloudflaresecretsstore/README.md) -- the vault behind `store_id` (BYO provider keys).
- [CloudflareSecretsStoreSecret](../cloudflaresecretsstoresecret/README.md) -- the provider keys themselves, scoped `ai_gateway`.
- [CloudflareWorker](../cloudflareworker/README.md) -- Workers calling models through the gateway endpoint.
