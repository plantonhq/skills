# CloudflareMtlsCertificate guide

The judgment this guide protects you from: everything on this kind is create-only, the certificate ID is the identity consumers hold, and destroying an upload out of order strands them.

## Immutable by design: rotate by replace

Every field forces replacement at the API -- there is no in-place update. The rotation discipline is a three-step dance, in this order:

1. Upload the NEW certificate (a new resource, or change the value and let the apply replace).
2. Re-point every consumer (zone TLS CA associations, Workers mTLS bindings, AOP rows) at the new `certificate_id`.
3. Destroy the OLD upload.

Skipping step 2 before step 3 leaves consumers referencing a deleted certificate -- client validation starts failing at the edge, not at apply time.

## CA vs leaf: the ca flag decides the consumer

`ca: true` is trust material for VALIDATING clients (Authenticated Origin Pulls, API Shield). It needs no private key -- uploading one anyway spreads a secret for nothing. `ca: false` is a leaf Cloudflare PRESENTS as a client (Workers mTLS bindings); that one needs its key. The flag must be stated explicitly and cannot change after upload.

## Self-signed is the point

Unlike zone-facing certificates, nothing here needs public trust -- your origin or your policy validates these. Mint CAs with your own PKI (or openssl) and keep the signing key outside Cloudflare entirely; the store only ever needs the certificate side of a CA.

## The store is content-addressed

Uploading content the store already deleted answers the SAME certificate id again, and uploading content that is currently LIVE is rejected outright (400 code 1471 "This certificate already exists for this account" -- both measured live 2026-08-28). Two consequences: you cannot stage a same-content replacement side by side (rotation needs genuinely new material), and automation that re-creates a just-deleted upload can rely on the id being stable. Cloudflare also canonicalizes the stored PEM to end with exactly one trailing newline; the modules send that form, so trailing-whitespace differences never churn the upload.

## The key never comes back

The API never returns `private_key`. An imported or refreshed resource re-asserts it from configuration, which means your secret store is the real system of record -- an upload whose key you lost cannot be re-presented, only replaced.

## Pairs well with

- [CloudflareZoneTlsSettings](../cloudflarezonetlssettings/README.md) -- the CA hostname associations that scope this CA to hostnames.
- [CloudflareAuthenticatedOriginPulls](../cloudflareauthenticatedoriginpulls/README.md) -- the zone-level enablement the CA validates for.
- [CloudflareWorker](../cloudflareworker/README.md) -- mTLS bindings that present leaf uploads from this store.
