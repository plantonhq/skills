CloudflareWaitingRoomEventSpec defines one scheduled event on a waiting room:
a time window (a product launch, a ticket on-sale) during which the event's
override values temporarily replace the room's own settings, with an optional
prequeue that gathers early arrivals before the doors open.

Events live on their own cadence -- created and deleted per launch while the
room persists -- which is why they are their own kind rather than a field of
the room.

Every override field is OPTIONAL and null-means-inherit: an unset override
leaves the room's value in charge for the event window; a set one replaces it
while the event is active. Cloudflare's API enforces the time rules (start at
least one minute before end; prequeue at least five minutes before start) --
this spec validates them up front so a bad window fails at manifest time, not
at apply.

## Example

```yaml
# A complete, protovalidate-valid CloudflareWaitingRoomEvent example: a
# prequeued, shuffled on-sale window with rate overrides. All time rules
# (start >= 1 min before end, prequeue >= 5 min before start) validate at
# manifest time.

## Field Details

### spec.waitingRoomId

`string | valueFrom` · required

The waiting room the event runs on.
When using value_from, defaults to CloudflareWaitingRoom kind and
status.outputs.waiting_room_id field path.

- references: CloudflareWaitingRoom (`status.outputs.waiting_room_id`)
- rule: {"required":true}
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: CloudflareWaitingRoom, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.waiting_room_id}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.zoneId

`string | valueFrom` · required

The zone the waiting room belongs to.
When using value_from, defaults to CloudflareDnsZone kind and status.outputs.zone_id field path.

- references: CloudflareDnsZone (`status.outputs.zone_id`)
- rule: {"required":true}
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: CloudflareDnsZone, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.zone_id}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.name

`string` · required

A name for the event (shown in the dashboard).

- rule: {"string":{"minLen":"1"}}

### spec.eventStartTime

`string` · required

When the event window opens, as RFC3339 (e.g. 2026-09-01T10:00:00Z). Must
be at least one minute before event_end_time.

- rule: event_start_time must be an RFC3339 timestamp (e.g. 2026-09-01T10:00:00Z)
- rule: {"required":true}

### spec.eventEndTime

`string` · required

When the event window closes, as RFC3339.

- rule: event_end_time must be an RFC3339 timestamp (e.g. 2026-09-01T14:00:00Z)
- rule: {"required":true}

### spec.prequeueStartTime

`string`

When early arrivals may start gathering in the prequeue, as RFC3339. Must
be at least five minutes before event_start_time. Unset means no prequeue.

- rule: prequeue_start_time must be an RFC3339 timestamp (e.g. 2026-09-01T09:30:00Z) or empty

### spec.shuffleAtEventStart

`bool` · optional (explicit presence)

Randomize the order of prequeued users when the event starts, instead of
first-come-first-served -- fairness for on-sales where arrival time is a
bot advantage. Requires a prequeue.

### spec.description

`string`

Description shown in the dashboard's event list.

### spec.suspended

`bool` · optional (explicit presence)

Suspend the event without deleting it -- the window comes and goes with no
effect while suspended.

### spec.customPageHtml

`string`

Override: custom queue-page HTML while the event is active (the room's
Advanced entitlement applies). Unset inherits the room's page.

### spec.disableSessionRenewal

`bool` · optional (explicit presence)

Override: freeze session renewal during the event (see the room field of
the same name). Unset inherits the room's setting.

### spec.newUsersPerMinute

`int32` · optional (explicit presence)

Override: new-users-per-minute admission rate during the event. Cloudflare
requires setting this together with total_active_users (both or neither);
the floor is 200. Unset inherits the room's rate.

- rule: {"int32":{"gte":200}}

### spec.totalActiveUsers

`int32` · optional (explicit presence)

Override: total concurrent active users during the event. Set together
with new_users_per_minute (both or neither); the floor is 200. Unset
inherits the room's cap.

- rule: {"int32":{"gte":200}}

### spec.queueingMethod

`string` · optional (explicit presence)

Override: queueing method during the event. Cloudflare's own schema leaves
this unvalidated on events -- the wall here mirrors the room's documented
set (a deliberate tightening).

- rule: {"string":{"in":["fifo","random","passthrough","reject"]}}

### spec.sessionDuration

`int32` · optional (explicit presence)

Override: session duration in minutes during the event (1-30). Unset
inherits the room's duration.

- rule: {"int32":{"lte":30,"gte":1}}

### spec.turnstileAction

`string` · optional (explicit presence)

Override: Turnstile action during the event (see the room field). Unset
inherits the room's action.

- rule: {"string":{"in":["log","infinite_queue"]}}

### spec.turnstileMode

`string` · optional (explicit presence)

Override: Turnstile mode during the event (see the room field). Unset
inherits the room's mode.

- rule: {"string":{"in":["off","invisible","visible_non_interactive","visible_managed"]}}

## Validation Rules

- `spec.start_before_end`: event_start_time must be at least one minute before event_end_time
- `spec.prequeue_five_minutes_before`: prequeue_start_time must be at least five minutes before event_start_time
- `spec.shuffle_requires_prequeue`: shuffle_at_event_start needs a prequeue to shuffle -- set prequeue_start_time
- `spec.users_pair_both_or_neither`: new_users_per_minute and total_active_users override each other's math -- Cloudflare requires setting both together or neither

## Outputs

Reference an output from another manifest as `valueFrom: {kind: CloudflareWaitingRoomEvent, name: <resource-name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.<output>}`.
