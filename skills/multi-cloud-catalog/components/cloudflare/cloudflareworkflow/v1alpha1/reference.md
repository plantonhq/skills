CloudflareWorkflowSpec registers a Workflow: a durable, multi-step
execution program served by a class exported from a deployed Worker
script. The Workflow object binds a name to that class and carries the
engine settings (instance retention, step limits, cron triggers);
instances of the workflow are then created at runtime by the Worker
platform, never by this resource.

Two provider behaviors worth knowing before authoring:
  - Create IS a PUT: registering a workflow name that already exists
    silently adopts and overwrites it (the name-as-upsert class). Choose
    names deliberately.
  - The API keeps answering for deleted workflows with an is_deleted
    marker instead of a 404 -- deletion is real, but tooling that probes
    for existence must read the marker.

## Example

```yaml
# Complete example manifest for CloudflareWorkflow. Registers a durable
# workflow served by the OrderFulfillment class exported from a deployed
# Worker script, with explicit retention, a step cap, and a nightly cron
# trigger. The script must be deployed before the workflow registers.

## Field Details

### spec.accountId

`string` · required

The Cloudflare account the workflow lives in.

- rule: account_id must be a 32-character hex string
- rule: {"required":true}

### spec.workflowName

`string` · required

The workflow's name -- its identity within the account. Changing it
replaces the workflow (the provider forces a new resource). Because the
API treats create as an upsert, a name collision overwrites the existing
workflow rather than failing.

- rule: {"string":{"minLen":"1"}}

### spec.className

`string` · required

The name of the class exported by the Worker script that implements
this workflow (the `WorkflowEntrypoint` subclass).

- rule: {"required":true}

### spec.scriptName

`string | valueFrom` · required

The Worker script that exports the workflow class: a literal script
name, or a reference to a CloudflareWorker resource's script_name
output. The script must be deployed before the workflow registers.

- references: CloudflareWorker (`status.outputs.script_name`)
- rule: {"required":true}
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: CloudflareWorker, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.script_name}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.defaultRetention

`CloudflareWorkflowRetention`

How long finished workflow instances are retained before the engine
discards their state. Omit to keep Cloudflare's defaults.

### spec.defaultRetention.errorRetention

`string`

Retention for instances that finished in error, as milliseconds
("5000") or a duration expression ("5 minutes").

### spec.defaultRetention.successRetention

`string`

Retention for instances that finished successfully, as milliseconds
("5000") or a duration expression ("5 minutes").

### spec.limits

`CloudflareWorkflowLimits`

Engine limits applied to every instance of this workflow. Omit to keep
Cloudflare's defaults.

### spec.limits.steps

`int64` · optional (explicit presence)

The maximum number of steps an instance may execute. Cloudflare
requires at least 1.

- rule: {"int64":{"gte":"1"}}

### spec.schedules

`[]CloudflareWorkflowSchedule`

Cron triggers that start new workflow instances on a schedule. Each
entry is one cron expression evaluated in UTC.

### spec.schedules[].cron

`string` · required

The cron expression (five-field, evaluated in UTC), e.g. "0 3 * * *"
for 03:00 daily.

- rule: {"required":true}

## Outputs

Reference an output from another manifest as `valueFrom: {kind: CloudflareWorkflow, name: <resource-name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.<output>}`.

| Output | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `status.outputs.workflow_name` | `string` | The workflow's name -- its identity within the account, and what Worker workflow bindings reference. |
| `status.outputs.version_id` | `string` | The ID of the workflow version the registration produced. |

## References

Fields that can point at another resource's outputs:

| Field | Kind | Output |
