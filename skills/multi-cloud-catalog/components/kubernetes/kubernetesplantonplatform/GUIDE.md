# KubernetesPlantonPlatform Guide

The judgment this guide carries: the platform is zero-config on purpose —
`version` is the ONE decision, and every other field is a refinement of a
platform that already works. Resist the urge to configure upfront; the
two settings that genuinely reward deciding early are the ones sign-in
bakes at first boot.

## Two settings are sticky — decide them before the first sign-in

The identity server bakes the platform's URL into its realm at first
boot. That makes exactly two fields effectively first-boot-sticky:
`ingress.hostname` (when you know the platform will live at a real URL —
through an Ingress controller or a Gateway API Gateway — set it before
anyone signs in) and `gateway.local_port` (two
port-forward platforms on one laptop need distinct ports, chosen before
the first visit). Everything else — storage, replicas, the runner's
cloud identity, the opt-in components — changes cleanly on a running
platform.

## Version is the upgrade lever, and it is never automated

`version` is required with no default, deliberately: a module-owned
default would turn a catalog update into a silent whole-platform upgrade
on the next apply. Day-2 for this kind IS editing `version` — the
operator rolls the platform to the new line. Pin it like you would pin a
database engine version.

## One operator, many platforms — and the two shared facts

Platforms are namespace-isolated (own URL, own identity server, own
databases) and one operator serves them all. Two cluster-level facts are
honest limits, not bugs: Tekton allows ONE cluster-wide build-events
sink, so keep `build.enabled` on for at most one platform per cluster;
and the cluster has one PlantonPlatform CRD schema (the operator's
version), while each platform still pins its own `spec.version`.

## The runner is where cloud credentials DON'T live

`runner.service_account_annotations` (workload identity — IRSA, GKE
Workload Identity, AKS) is the right answer wherever the cluster
supports it; `runner.cloud_credentials_secret_name` (a Secret YOU own in
the platform's namespace) is the static-keys fallback. Either way the
platform stores nothing — rotation is your annotation or your Secret,
never a platform record.

## Storage: one global dial, honest failures

`storage.size` + `storage.storage_class_name` lift EVERY platform volume
at once — built for backends with minimum-size floors (some NAS backends
refuse volumes under hundreds of Gi; one `size: 800Gi` satisfies them
all). The operator preflights that the chosen class can actually
provision and, when a volume sticks, the CR's per-component status names
the exact problem and fix — read `kubectl get plantonplatforms` status
before reading pod logs.

## Destroy and the reinstall truth

Teardown is Kubernetes garbage collection: every operator-created object
is owner-referenced to the declaration, so deleting the platform
completes with or without the operator running, and database credentials
and volumes die together — no orphaned volume can hold a password a
reinstall cannot match. Two residues to know: build caches and workflow
volumes may survive in the namespace, so a reinstall into the SAME
namespace should be preceded by deleting it (automatic when this
resource owned the namespace via `create_namespace`); and the platform's
namespace-qualified token-review ClusterRole/Binding lingers inert (its
subject ServiceAccount died with the platform) until an operator release
adds the janitor.

## On the diagram

The platform draws an explicit `depends_on` edge TO its
KubernetesPlantonOperator — no spec field consumes an operator output
(the coupling is the cluster-global CRD contract), so composed charts
declare the edge in metadata. The `planton-on-kubernetes` infra-chart
carries namespace + operator + platform as one deployable arm; its
multi-platform variant is one operator plus N namespace+platform pairs.
