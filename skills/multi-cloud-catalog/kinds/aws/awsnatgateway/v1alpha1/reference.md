AwsNatGatewaySpec defines a NAT gateway for an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

A NAT (network address translation) gateway gives instances in a private
subnet outbound access without exposing them to inbound connections from the
internet. It is an AWS-managed, highly-available service that lives in a
single subnet and is referenced by other subnets' route tables as the target
of their default route.

There are two kinds, selected by connectivity_type:
  - public  (the common case): the gateway lives in a PUBLIC subnet (one that
    routes to an internet gateway) and is fronted by an Elastic IP. Private
    subnets send 0.0.0.0/0 to it to reach the internet outbound-only.
  - private: the gateway lives in any subnet and has no Elastic IP. It enables
    outbound communication to other VPCs or an on-premises network (via a
    transit/VPN/peering path) while keeping instances unreachable from those
    networks.

Orthogonally, availability_mode selects the placement model:
  - zonal (default, the classic form): one gateway in one subnet
    (subnet_id), one AZ. Zone-resilient architectures deploy one per AZ.
  - regional: one gateway spanning every AZ of a VPC (vpc_id), managed by
    AWS as a single unit. AWS either picks the zones automatically (leave
    availability_zone_addresses empty) or follows the explicit per-AZ
    layout given there. Creating a regional gateway additionally requires
    the ec2:DescribeAvailabilityZones permission on the deploying role.

A NAT gateway does not, by itself, route anything: a private subnet becomes
NAT-egressed only when its route table sends a default route
(target_type = nat_gateway) to this gateway. The Elastic IP is composed by
reference (allocation_id -> AwsElasticIp), never embedded, so the address has
its own lifecycle and can be reasoned about as a first-class node.

## Example

## Field Details

### spec.region

`string` · required

AWS region the NAT gateway is created in. Must match the region of the
subnet it lives in. Example: "us-west-2", "eu-west-1". This drives provider
construction, so it is required even though the gateway logically inherits
the subnet's region.

- rule: {"string":{"minLen":"1"}}

### spec.connectivityType

`string`

How the gateway connects: "public" (default) or "private".

- "public": the gateway is placed in a public subnet and assigned an Elastic
  IP (allocation_id is required); it provides outbound internet access for
  private subnets that route to it.
- "private": the gateway has no Elastic IP and provides outbound access only
  to other private networks (peered/transit/VPN), never the internet.

AWS's own default for a new NAT gateway is public; this field is required so
the choice is always explicit (an empty value is rejected) and the two IaC
engines never need to invent a default. ForceNew: changing it replaces the
gateway.

- default: `public`
- rule: connectivity_type must be one of: public, private

### spec.subnetId

`string | valueFrom`

The subnet the NAT gateway is created in (zonal mode only -- required
there, forbidden for a regional gateway, which spans the whole VPC).
Supply a literal subnet-id or reference an AwsSubnet and the platform
resolves its subnet_id output. For a public gateway this must be a PUBLIC
subnet (one whose route table reaches an internet gateway); for a private
gateway any subnet works. Immutable: changing the subnet replaces the
gateway.

- references: AwsSubnet (`status.outputs.subnet_id`)
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: AwsSubnet, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.subnet_id}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.allocationId

`string | valueFrom`

The Elastic IP allocation that gives a zonal public gateway its stable
outbound address. Supply a literal eipalloc-id or reference an
AwsElasticIp and the platform resolves its allocation_id output. Required
for a zonal public gateway; must be empty when connectivity_type is
private, and empty for a regional gateway (regional addressing lives in
availability_zone_addresses or is AWS-managed). ForceNew: changing it
replaces the gateway.

- references: AwsElasticIp (`status.outputs.allocation_id`)
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: AwsElasticIp, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.allocation_id}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.privateIp

`string`

The private IPv4 address to assign to a private gateway from the subnet's
range. Only valid when connectivity_type is private; leave empty to let AWS
choose. ForceNew: changing it replaces the gateway.

### spec.secondaryAllocationIds

`[]string | valueFrom`

Additional Elastic IP allocations to attach to a public gateway, increasing
the number of available source ports for very high-throughput egress. Each
entry is a literal eipalloc-id or a reference to an AwsElasticIp. Only valid
when connectivity_type is public.

- references: AwsElasticIp (`status.outputs.allocation_id`)
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: AwsElasticIp, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.allocation_id}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.secondaryPrivateIpAddresses

`[]string`

Additional private IPv4 addresses to assign to a private gateway, increasing
the number of available source ports. Only valid when connectivity_type is
private. Mutually exclusive with secondary_private_ip_address_count.

### spec.secondaryPrivateIpAddressCount

`int32`

Number of additional private IPv4 addresses to let AWS assign to a private
gateway (an alternative to listing them explicitly). Only valid when
connectivity_type is private. Mutually exclusive with
secondary_private_ip_addresses.

### spec.availabilityMode

`string`

Placement model: "zonal" (default -- the classic single-subnet,
single-AZ gateway) or "regional" (one AWS-managed gateway spanning every
AZ of the VPC). Leave empty for zonal. ForceNew: changing the mode
replaces the gateway.

- default: `zonal`
- rule: availability_mode must be one of: zonal, regional

### spec.vpcId

`string | valueFrom`

The VPC a REGIONAL gateway spans (required for regional mode, forbidden
for zonal, where the subnet implies the VPC). Supply a literal vpc-id or
reference an AwsVpc and the platform resolves its vpc_id output.
Immutable: changing the VPC replaces the gateway.

- references: AwsVpc (`status.outputs.vpc_id`)
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: AwsVpc, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.vpc_id}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.availabilityZoneAddresses

`[]AwsNatGatewayAvailabilityZoneAddress`

Explicit per-AZ layout for a regional gateway. Leave empty to let AWS
choose the zones and manage addresses automatically (auto mode); list
entries to pin the zones -- and, for a public regional gateway, the
Elastic IPs -- yourself (manual mode). Switching a regional gateway
between auto and manual replaces it (verified provider behavior).

- rule: each availability_zone_addresses entry needs availability_zone or availability_zone_id

### spec.availabilityZoneAddresses[].availabilityZone

`string`

The availability zone, by name (e.g. "us-west-2a"). At least one of
availability_zone or availability_zone_id is required per entry; both
may be set (AWS reports both).

### spec.availabilityZoneAddresses[].availabilityZoneId

`string`

The availability zone, by ID (e.g. "usw2-az1") -- stable across AWS
accounts, unlike zone names. At least one of availability_zone or
availability_zone_id is required per entry.

### spec.availabilityZoneAddresses[].allocationIds

`[]string | valueFrom`

Elastic IP allocations serving this zone (public regional gateways
only -- a private gateway carries no Elastic IPs). Each entry is a
literal eipalloc-id or a reference to an AwsElasticIp.

- references: AwsElasticIp (`status.outputs.allocation_id`)
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: AwsElasticIp, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.allocation_id}} -- a bare string does not parse

## Validation Rules

- `zonal_requires_subnet`: subnet_id is required for a zonal NAT gateway (availability_mode empty or 'zonal')
- `regional_requires_vpc`: a regional NAT gateway requires vpc_id and must not set subnet_id
- `zonal_forbids_regional_surface`: vpc_id and availability_zone_addresses are only valid when availability_mode is 'regional'
- `regional_forbids_zonal_addressing`: allocation_id, secondary_allocation_ids, private_ip, and the secondary private IP fields are zonal-mode surface; a regional gateway uses availability_zone_addresses
- `public_requires_allocation_id`: allocation_id is required when connectivity_type is public (a zonal public NAT gateway needs an Elastic IP)
- `private_forbids_eip`: allocation_id, secondary_allocation_ids, and availability_zone_addresses[].allocation_ids are not allowed when connectivity_type is private
- `public_forbids_private_addressing`: private_ip, secondary_private_ip_addresses, and secondary_private_ip_address_count are only valid when connectivity_type is private
- `secondary_private_ip_exclusive`: secondary_private_ip_addresses and secondary_private_ip_address_count are mutually exclusive
