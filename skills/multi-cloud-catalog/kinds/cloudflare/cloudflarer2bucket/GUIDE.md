# CloudflareR2Bucket guide

Operational judgment for R2 buckets. The README covers what each field is; this covers how the pieces interact.

## Destroy requires an empty bucket

R2 refuses to delete a bucket holding objects, and the provider does no draining — a teardown of a non-empty bucket fails at the API with a raw error. Empty the bucket first (a lifecycle rule with a short expiry, or an explicit purge) and treat "who empties the bucket" as part of every decommission plan.

## Jurisdiction is identity, not configuration

The jurisdiction ("default", "eu", "fedramp", "us") is fixed at creation and joins the import ID as a mandatory third segment — a default-jurisdiction bucket imports with the literal `default`. Every bucket-scoped companion (CORS, lifecycle, lock, notifications, domains) is created inside the same jurisdiction automatically.

## The location hint only counts once

`location` is honored the first time a bucket with that name is created and is best-effort even then. Changing it later changes nothing — the provider deliberately preserves the original placement rather than recreating the bucket.

## r2.dev is for development; custom domains are for production

The managed `r2.dev` public domain is rate-limited, and the provider cannot destroy or even re-read it once enabled — it stays until manually disabled in the dashboard. Serve production traffic from `custom_domains` on a zone in the same account, which also unlocks Cloudflare's cache and TLS controls.

## Object lock is a commitment

A lock rule retains matching objects for its whole window — nothing, including a bucket teardown, deletes them early. Locked objects also keep the bucket non-empty, which blocks destroy until the retention expires. Scope lock rules by prefix and keep retention as short as compliance allows.

## Event notifications ride the Queues entitlement

Notifications deliver into a Cloudflare Queue, so they inherit the queue's plan gating (see the CloudflareQueue guide) and the queue must exist before the notification that names it.

## Event notifications have their own lifecycle — on both ends

Two live-measured walls (2026-08-26). First, the notification config outlives its bucket: deleting a bucket out-of-band does NOT delete its notification configs, and a dangling config blocks the target queue's deletion with 400 code 11017 "serves as a target for event notifications" — a declared teardown is safe (the notification is destroyed before the bucket), but if a bucket was deleted some other way, delete its notification config explicitly before retiring the queue. Second, the per-queue write MERGES rules instead of replacing them: re-putting a rule identical to one already live answers 400 code 11020 "rules have invalid overlap", so adopting a bucket whose notification config already exists means deleting that config first and letting the next apply re-create it — there is no import and no idempotent re-put.
