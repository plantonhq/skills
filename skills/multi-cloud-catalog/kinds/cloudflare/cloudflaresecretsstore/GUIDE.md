# CloudflareSecretsStore guide

The judgment this guide protects you from: the store is a one-per-account singleton whose destruction takes every secret with it -- it is permanent infrastructure wearing a two-field spec.

## One per account: create once, adopt otherwise

Cloudflare allows a single Secrets Store per account. A create against an account that already has one (dashboard-created, or another team's) fails at the API with error 1003 `maximum_stores_exceeded` (live-measured). The correct move is adopt-by-import (`{account_id}/{store_id}`), never a second create. In an organization, decide early WHICH manifest owns the store -- everything else references it. One more trap: Cloudflare may have auto-provisioned an EMPTY `default_secrets_store` on your account long before you ever used the product -- that placeholder occupies the only slot, so your first managed create can fail on an account that "never used" Secrets Store. If it is genuinely empty, deleting it frees the slot; otherwise adopt it.

## Renaming is destruction

Both fields force replacement, and replacing the store destroys every secret inside it -- every Worker binding and AI Gateway key breaks at once. Pick a boring, permanent name ("account-secrets") and never touch it. If you truly must rename: create nothing until every secret has been re-created under the new store and every consumer re-pointed.

## Destroy last, if ever

The store's blast radius is every secret it holds. In teardown flows, destroy secrets and their consumers first; leave the store for the very end -- or leave it standing, it is free.

## Pairs well with

- [CloudflareSecretsStoreSecret](../cloudflaresecretsstoresecret/README.md) -- the secrets inside the store, each rotating on its own cadence.
- [CloudflareWorker](../cloudflareworker/README.md) -- secrets-store bindings that read secrets at runtime.
- [CloudflareAiGateway](../cloudflareaigateway/README.md) -- BYO-keys authentication backed by this store.
