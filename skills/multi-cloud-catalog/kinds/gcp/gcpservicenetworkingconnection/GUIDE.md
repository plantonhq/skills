# GcpServiceNetworkingConnection Guide

The judgment this guide protects: this peering is a singleton with
gravity. One connection exists per (network, service) pair, everything
private-IP (Cloud SQL, AlloyDB, Memorystore PRIVATE_SERVICE_ACCESS,
Filestore) hangs off it, and both its capacity and its teardown follow
rules that surprise people.

## One connection per pair — widen, never duplicate

GCP rejects a second connection for the same (network, service) pair.
When the producer runs out of address space, the answer is ALWAYS to
append ranges to THIS resource's `reservedPeeringRanges` — growth is
additive and safe (already-provisioned producer subnets are untouched).
A second connection resource for the same pair fails its create.

## Size ranges generously up front

Producers carve service subnets out of your reserved ranges and cannot
use space that is too fragmented. A /16 is the standard default; a
too-small range surfaces LATER, as instance-creation failures when the
producer cannot allocate — not at connection time. Reserve big once
rather than appending slivers under incident pressure.

## The composition

The connection composes two first-class kinds: the `GcpVpcNetwork` being
peered and one or more `GcpGlobalAddress` resources (INTERNAL,
VPC_PEERING purpose) referenced BY NAME — not by self-link or CIDR. In a
chart: network → address range(s) → this connection → private-IP
instances, in that order.

## Adopting a pre-existing connection

When a connection for the pair already exists outside management (a
gcloud or console flow), the create fails with "Cannot modify allocated
ranges". `updateOnCreationFail: true` converts that failure into an
in-place update of the existing connection's ranges — a deliberate
adoption lever. Leave it false otherwise: silently adopting someone
else's peering is worse than failing loudly.

## Teardown ordering is the trap

GCP refuses to delete the connection while any producer still holds
subnets in the reserved ranges — destroy the Cloud SQL / AlloyDB /
Memorystore instances FIRST, then the connection, then the address
ranges. In chart teardown this ordering falls out of the dependency
graph; in manual cleanup it is the step people miss, and the destroy
failure ("producer still has allocations") is the system enforcing it.

And ordering alone is not always enough: the producer releases its hold
ASYNCHRONOUSLY after the last instance is deleted, and the wait is not
the few minutes GCP's docs suggest — live-measured in 2026-08, a
deleted private-IP Cloud SQL instance kept the connection rejecting
deletion ("Producer services are still using this connection") for over
40 minutes. Budget for that lag in automation that deletes an instance
and its connection in one pass, or — when the whole VPC is being
retired anyway — set `deletionPolicy: ABANDON` on the connection and
let the network deletion clear the consumer-side peering (see below).

`deletionPolicy` completes the picture: `PREVENT` for the connection
under a production database fleet; `ABANDON` removes it from management
while the peering keeps serving — the historical escape hatch for stuck
teardowns, at the price of an unmanaged peering that a later cleanup
will not know about.

## No cloud-side name

The connection is addressed by (network, service); `metadata.name` names
only the Planton resource, and the peering appears on the VPC named
after the service (e.g. `servicenetworking-googleapis-com`).
