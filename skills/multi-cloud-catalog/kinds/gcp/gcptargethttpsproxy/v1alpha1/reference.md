GcpTargetHttpsProxySpec defines a Compute Engine target HTTPS proxy — the
TLS-termination node of an Application Load Balancer (and of Traffic
Director meshes). A target HTTPS proxy binds a forwarding rule (the VIP)
to a URL map (the routing brain) and owns everything about the
client-facing TLS handshake: which certificates are presented, which TLS
policy constrains ciphers and versions, whether QUIC (HTTP/3) is
negotiated, and whether TLS 1.3 0-RTT early data is accepted.

One kind, two scopes. With region empty the proxy is GLOBAL (the global
external ALB, the cross-region internal ALB, Traffic Director); with
region set it is REGIONAL (the regional external ALB and the regional
internal ALB), and every link in its chain must be regional too: a
regional URL map, regional certificates, a regional SSL policy, and a
regional forwarding rule in front. A proxy cannot move between scopes.

Certificates attach through exactly one of three mechanisms:
  - ssl_certificates: classic Compute Engine SSL certificates (the
    Google-managed GcpManagedSslCertificate kind, or self-managed compute
    certificates), up to 15 per proxy. On a regional proxy these must be
    regional self-managed certificates (GcpSslCertificate with region).
  - certificate_manager_certificates: Certificate Manager certificates —
    honored by the cross-region internal ALB (INTERNAL_MANAGED) and by
    the regional ALBs (regional certificates in the proxy's region).
  - certificate_map: a Certificate Manager certificate map that selects
    the certificate by SNI hostname at scale — only honored by GLOBAL
    external ALBs (EXTERNAL / EXTERNAL_MANAGED); required beyond ~15 certs.

Traffic Director proxies (INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED) skip client certificates
entirely and drive TLS through server_tls_policy instead.

url_map, certificates, certificate_map, ssl_policy, server_tls_policy, and
quic_override all update in place via dedicated API calls; name,
description, keep-alive, early data, proxy_bind, and region are
immutable.

## Field Details

### spec.projectId

`string | valueFrom`

The GCP project that owns the target HTTPS proxy.
Can be a literal project ID or a reference to a GcpProject resource.
If omitted, the provider's default project is used.
Immutable: changing it destroys and recreates the proxy.

- references: GcpProject (`status.outputs.project_id`)
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: GcpProject, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.project_id}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.proxyName

`string`

Name of the proxy in GCP. Must be 1-63 characters: lowercase letters,
digits, and hyphens; must start with a letter and end with a letter or
digit. If not specified, defaults to metadata.name.
Immutable: changing it destroys and recreates the proxy, briefly
breaking every forwarding rule that references the old self_link.

- rule: proxy_name must be RFC1035-compliant: 1-63 lowercase letters, digits, or hyphens; must start with a letter and end with a letter or digit

### spec.description

`string`

What this proxy fronts and which forwarding rule points at it — write it
for the operator tracing a TLS incident later. Immutable.

- rule: {"string":{"maxLen":"2048"}}

### spec.region

`string`

The scope selector. Empty builds a GLOBAL target HTTPS proxy (the
global external ALB, the cross-region internal ALB, Traffic Director);
a region name such as us-central1 builds a REGIONAL one (the regional
external ALB and the regional internal ALB). Everything it references
must then be regional in the same region: the URL map, the certificates
(regional GcpSslCertificate or regional Certificate Manager
certificates), and the SSL policy — and the forwarding rule in front of
it. The global-only levers (certificate_map, quic_override,
tls_early_data, proxy_bind) are rejected when region is set. Immutable:
a proxy cannot move between scopes or regions.

- rule: region must be a valid GCP region name such as us-central1, or empty for a global target HTTPS proxy

### spec.urlMap

`string | valueFrom` · required

The URL map that decides where each decrypted request goes — the proxy's
single routing dependency. Reference a GcpUrlMap resource or provide a
URL map self-link directly. Required. A regional proxy can only point at
a regional URL map in its own region (a GcpUrlMap declared with the same
region). Mutable: GCP swaps it in place (a dedicated setUrlMap call), so
repointing a live frontend at a new routing table causes no downtime.

- references: GcpUrlMap (`status.outputs.self_link`)
- rule: {"required":true}
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: GcpUrlMap, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.self_link}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.sslCertificates

`[]string | valueFrom`

Compute Engine SSL certificates presented to clients (1-15). Reference
GcpManagedSslCertificate resources (the default kind), self-managed
GcpSslCertificate resources via an explicit valueFrom.kind (both are
declared candidates, so the self_link output fills in), or provide
SSL certificate self-links directly — both certificate kinds share one
API collection and attach identically. The load balancer picks the
certificate matching the client's SNI hostname.
On a REGIONAL proxy the certificates must be regional self-managed
certificates in the proxy's region (a GcpSslCertificate declared with
the same region, attached with valueFrom.kind: GcpSslCertificate) —
Google-managed compute certificates are global only.
Not honored by Traffic Director (INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED) proxies — use
server_tls_policy there. Mutually exclusive with
certificate_manager_certificates and certificate_map. Mutable: GCP swaps
the list in place (setSslCertificates), which is how zero-downtime
certificate rotation works — attach the replacement before detaching the
old one.

- references: GcpManagedSslCertificate (`status.outputs.self_link`), GcpSslCertificate (`status.outputs.self_link`)
- rule: {"repeated":{"maxItems":"15"}}
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: GcpManagedSslCertificate, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.self_link}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.certificateManagerCertificates

`[]string | valueFrom`

Certificate Manager certificates presented to clients — honored by the
cross-region internal ALB (INTERNAL_MANAGED) on a global proxy and by
the regional ALBs on a regional proxy (regional certificates in the
proxy's region); global external ALBs use certificate_map instead.
Reference GcpCertManagerCert resources or provide certificate resource
names directly, in the form
projects/{project}/locations/{location}/certificates/{name} (a
//certificatemanager.googleapis.com/ prefix is also accepted). Mutually
exclusive with ssl_certificates and certificate_map. Mutable.

- references: GcpCertManagerCert (`status.outputs.certificate_name`)
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: GcpCertManagerCert, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.certificate_name}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.certificateMap

`string`

A Certificate Manager certificate map that selects the served
certificate by SNI hostname — the mechanism for serving many domains
(SaaS custom domains) beyond the 15-certificate list limit. Only honored
by GLOBAL external ALBs (EXTERNAL / EXTERNAL_MANAGED); the regional
proxy carries no such argument, so it is rejected when region is set.
Format:
//certificatemanager.googleapis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/certificateMaps/{name}.
Mutually exclusive with ssl_certificates and
certificate_manager_certificates. Mutable.

- rule: {"string":{"maxLen":"1024"}}

### spec.sslPolicy

`string | valueFrom`

The SSL policy constraining TLS versions and cipher suites for client
handshakes. Reference a GcpSslPolicy resource or provide an SSL policy
self-link directly (e.g.
https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/global/sslPolicies/{name}).
A regional proxy takes a regional SSL policy in its own region (a
GcpSslPolicy declared with the same region). If not set, GCP applies
its permissive default policy (min TLS 1.0, COMPATIBLE profile) — set
one to enforce modern TLS for compliance. Mutable: GCP swaps it in place
(setSslPolicy).

- references: GcpSslPolicy (`status.outputs.self_link`)
- rule: write as {value: <literal>} or {valueFrom: {kind: GcpSslPolicy, name: <that resource's name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.self_link}} -- a bare string does not parse

### spec.serverTlsPolicy

`string`

A network security ServerTlsPolicy resource that configures server-side
TLS — the mTLS mechanism: it can demand and validate client
certificates. Applies to global proxies behind EXTERNAL /
EXTERNAL_MANAGED / INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED forwarding rules and to
regional proxies (a regional policy in the proxy's region); for Traffic
Director this is the ONLY TLS lever (ssl_certificates are ignored).
The policy is made outside the catalog (in Network Security, with its
trust config of CA anchors; no catalog kind produces it), so write its
full name: projects/{project}/locations/{global|region}/serverTlsPolicies/{name}.
If left blank, no server-side TLS policy applies. Mutable — and
clearable: removing it PATCHes the proxy back to no policy.

### spec.quicOverride

`string` · optional (explicit presence)

QUIC (HTTP/3) negotiation policy. NONE lets Google decide (currently
enables QUIC), ENABLE forces QUIC negotiation on, DISABLE turns it off.
GCP default: NONE. Global proxies only — regional ALBs do not negotiate
QUIC, and the regional resource carries no such argument. Mutable.

- rule: quic_override must be one of NONE, ENABLE, or DISABLE

### spec.tlsEarlyData

`string`

TLS 1.3 0-RTT "early data" policy — lets a resuming client send the
first HTTP request inside the TLS handshake itself (zero effective round
trips, over TCP and QUIC/HTTP-3). Early data is replayable by design, so
the modes trade latency against replay safety: STRICT accepts it only
for safe methods (GET/HEAD) with no query parameters, PERMISSIVE for all
requests, UNRESTRICTED additionally skips rejecting non-idempotent
replays (only for services that tolerate replays), DISABLED turns it
off. Empty lets GCP apply its default (DISABLED). Global proxies only.
Immutable: changing it destroys and recreates the proxy.

- rule: tls_early_data must be one of STRICT, PERMISSIVE, UNRESTRICTED, or DISABLED

### spec.httpKeepAliveTimeoutSec

`int32`

Seconds an idle client connection is kept open after a response while no
matching traffic flows (5-1200). Only honored by load balancers with the
EXTERNAL_MANAGED scheme (the envoy-based external ALBs, global and
regional), where the GCP default is 610; the classic EXTERNAL ALB
ignores it. Raise it above your clients' own keep-alive to avoid the
load balancer closing connections first. 0 means unset (GCP applies its
default). Immutable on both scopes: changing it destroys and recreates
the proxy.

- rule: http_keep_alive_timeout_sec must be between 5 and 1200 seconds (or 0 to let GCP apply its default)

### spec.proxyBind

`bool`

Bind the proxy to the private IPs of the Traffic Director mesh instead
of Google's edge. Only meaningful when the forwarding rule that
references this proxy uses the INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED scheme (Traffic
Director); leave false for internet-facing load balancers. Global
proxies only — Traffic Director has no regional proxy, and the regional
resource carries no such argument. Immutable.

### spec.deletionPolicy

`string`

Deletion policy for the proxy — what happens when this resource is
destroyed:
  ""        -- same as "DELETE" (provider default)
  "DELETE"  -- the proxy is deleted (GCP refuses while a forwarding
               rule still references it, so a TLS frontend cannot be
               torn down out from under its VIP)
  "PREVENT" -- destroy FAILS; protects a production TLS frontend from
               accidental teardown
  "ABANDON" -- the proxy is removed from management but keeps
               terminating TLS in GCP

- rule: deletion_policy must be one of: DELETE, PREVENT, ABANDON

## Validation Rules

- `single_certificate_source`: choose one certificate mechanism: ssl_certificates (classic compute certificates), certificate_manager_certificates (cross-region internal ALB, regional ALBs), or certificate_map (SNI-scale global external ALB) — GCP rejects combinations
- `certificate_map_global_only`: certificate_map is a global-proxy lever — a regional target HTTPS proxy takes ssl_certificates (regional GcpSslCertificate) or certificate_manager_certificates (regional Certificate Manager certificates); clear region or remove certificate_map
- `quic_override_global_only`: quic_override is a global-proxy lever — regional Application Load Balancers do not negotiate QUIC; clear region or remove quic_override
- `tls_early_data_global_only`: tls_early_data is a global-proxy lever — the regional target HTTPS proxy has no early-data policy; clear region or remove tls_early_data
- `proxy_bind_global_only`: proxy_bind is a global-proxy (Traffic Director) lever — a regional target HTTPS proxy has no mesh to bind to; clear region or remove proxy_bind

## Outputs

Reference an output from another manifest as `valueFrom: {kind: GcpTargetHttpsProxy, name: <resource-name>, fieldPath: status.outputs.<output>}`.

| Output | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `status.outputs.self_link` | `string` | Self-link URI of the target HTTPS proxy. This is the value a forwarding rule references as its target — the composition handle that puts a VIP in front of this proxy. Format: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/global/targetHttpsProxies/{name} (a regional proxy's link carries regions/{region} in place of global). |
| `status.outputs.proxy_name` | `string` | Name of the proxy as it exists in GCP. |
| `status.outputs.proxy_id` | `string` | Server-assigned numeric ID of the proxy. |
| `status.outputs.fingerprint` | `string` | Server-computed fingerprint for optimistic concurrency control. |
| `status.outputs.region` | `string` | Region of a regional target HTTPS proxy; empty for a global one. Downstream blocks read it to confirm scope compatibility (a regional link must point at a regional target in the same region), and the E2E verifier picks the regional or global API by it. |
