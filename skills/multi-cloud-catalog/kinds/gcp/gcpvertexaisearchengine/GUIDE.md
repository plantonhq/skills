# GcpVertexAiSearchEngine Guide

This guide explains how a Vertex AI Search engine is shaped and the decisions behind the spec. For field-by-field detail see the README; for ready-made configurations see the presets.

The product has worn three names. The API is **Discovery Engine** (`discoveryengine.googleapis.com`), the search product is **Vertex AI Search**, and the console now groups it under **AI Applications**, with **Gemini Enterprise** as the assistant built on the same engines. This kind is the engine -- the "app" -- in all three vocabularies.

## One kind, three engines

Google's API has one `Engine` resource with a solution type; its provider splits it into three resources -- a search engine, a chat engine, a recommendation engine -- because each carries a different configuration block. This kind keeps the API's shape: `engineType` selects which resource the modules build (empty means `SEARCH`), the shared fields (`engineId`, `displayName`, `location`, `collectionId`, `dataStoreIds`, `industryVertical`, `commonConfig`) apply to all three, and each arm's own block sits at the spec's top level under the provider's own name:

- **SEARCH** -- `searchEngineConfig` (tier, add-ons, license tier; Google requires the block, so the module always sends it), plus `appType`, `disableAnalytics`, `features`, `kmsKeyName`, and `knowledgeGraphConfig`, which exist only on this resource.
- **CHAT** -- `chatEngineConfig`: exactly one of "create a Dialogflow CX agent" (`agentCreationConfig`) or "link one" (`dialogflowAgentToLink`, a `GcpDialogflowCxAgent` reference or a literal agent name), immutable. Link from one side: a linked agent leaves its own `genAppBuilderSettings` unset.
- **RECOMMENDATION** -- `mediaRecommendationEngineConfig`: the model type, objective, training state, and feature config. This resource has no collection id and no KMS key, and takes exactly one data store; the spec walls all three.

Rules the spec enforces are the provider's: the chat block is required on CHAT and forbidden elsewhere, the search-only fields exist only on SEARCH, a chat engine is GENERIC, a recommendation engine is GENERIC or MEDIA. `engineType` is immutable; changing it replaces the engine.

## Data stores by reference

`dataStoreIds` lists `GcpVertexAiSearchDataStore` references (their `data_store_id` outputs). Every store must be in the engine's location and enrolled in the engine's solution -- `SOLUTION_TYPE_CHAT` for a chat engine, and so on. A search engine over several stores is a blended search; a recommendation engine takes one.

`collectionId` is `default_collection` -- where every `GcpVertexAiSearchDataStore` lives -- unless the engine searches stores a `GcpVertexAiSearchDataConnector` created, in which case it references the connector's `collection_id` output.

## Controls, and the serving config that applies them

A control is one rule that shapes results: `synonymsAction` treats terms as equivalent, `boostAction` reorders documents matching a filter (by a fixed amount or a curve over a numeric or freshness field), `filterAction` drops non-matching documents, `promoteAction` pins a link, `redirectAction` sends a query elsewhere. Each has exactly one action, an optional set of conditions (query terms, a regex, time windows), and an id.

Controls belong to one engine and nothing else references them, so they are folded as `controls[]`. A control takes effect only when the engine's **serving config** lists it: `servingConfig` carries five id lists, one per action, and the spec checks that every id names a declared control with that action -- the mistake of listing a boost control under filters is caught before Google sees it. Google creates the default serving config (`default_search`) with the engine; the provider PATCHes it and never deletes it, so `servingConfig` configures rather than owns. `solutionType` on every control is derived from the arm, because the provider hard-codes each engine's.

## The widget

`widgetConfig` configures Google's embeddable search widget and hosted web app: who may load it (`accessSettings` -- public from allowlisted domains, or authenticated, optionally through a workforce identity pool provider), the homepage shortcuts, the logo, and the UI (`interactionType` decides whether a generated answer or a conversation sits above the results; `dataStoreUiConfigs` map each store's fields to facets and result components; `generativeAnswerConfig` tunes the answer). Google creates the default widget config with a search engine; this block PATCHes it, and a widget config cannot be deleted, so destroy leaves it as configured.

## Assistants

`assistants[]` are Gemini Enterprise assistants on the engine: a content policy (banned phrases), Model Armor sanitization of prompts and responses (each template a `GcpModelArmorTemplate` reference or a literal resource name; fail open or closed), web grounding, and generation settings. They need Gemini Enterprise seats licensed on the project.

## Encryption, the chat agent, and destroy

`kmsKeyName` encrypts a search engine under a Cloud KMS key in its location (the chat and recommendation resources offer none). A chat engine that creates its agent does so through Google's service agent; the module enables the Dialogflow API so a fresh project works. `deletionPolicy` is fanned to the controls and assistants: `DELETE` (default), `PREVENT`, or `ABANDON`. Destroy the engine before its data stores -- Google refuses to delete a store an engine still uses -- and expect Google to reserve a deleted engine's id for a while.
