# KubernetesKubePrometheusStack Guide

The judgment this guide carries: this stack is closer to cluster
infrastructure than to an app — one per cluster, and HALF THE CATALOG's
monitoring toggles silently depend on the CRDs it installs. Whether to
run it at all is the assembled-vs-all-in-one decision, which lives in the
[observability-stack pattern](../../_patterns/observability-stack.md).

## The serviceMonitor seam — the trap that spans the catalog

Kinds across the catalog carry a `serviceMonitor` (or metrics)
toggle — ingress-nginx, databases, operators. Every one of those toggles
creates a ServiceMonitor, and ServiceMonitor is a CRD THIS stack installs:
enable any component's monitor before the stack exists and THAT
component's release fails to install. When an architecture turns on any
monitoring toggle anywhere, this stack (or its CRDs) must already be on
the cluster — deploy it early, in the shared-cluster chart.

Alert and recording rules of your own are declared as
[KubernetesPrometheusRule](../kubernetesprometheusrule/GUIDE.md) objects,
not through this stack's spec; it lists this stack as its prerequisite.
Under the default `all_monitors` discovery every rule object loads; under
`release_managed_only` only objects labelled `release: <release_name>` do,
so a rule meant for a fenced stack carries that label in its own `labels`.

Scraping beyond a component's own toggle is declared the same way:
[KubernetesServiceMonitor](../kubernetesservicemonitor/GUIDE.md) for a
workload whose Service names its metrics port, and
[KubernetesPodMonitor](../kubernetespodmonitor/GUIDE.md) for pods no
Service exposes. Both list this stack as their prerequisite and load under
the same discovery rules as a rule object.

## One per cluster, by CRD physics

The monitoring CRDs are cluster-scoped singletons; a second stack must
skip CRDs and scope its discovery — an advanced posture the reference
page describes, never the default. Treat the stack like the operators:
one install, shared-cluster layer, its own namespace (`createNamespace: true` is
the [namespace-ownership pattern](../../_patterns/namespace-ownership.md)'s
sole-tenant case). Note the reference page's 26-character name budget —
the chart silently truncates longer fullnames.

The one second stack worth running is a monitoring hub's receiver,
where other clusters remote-write. It must bring nothing the first
stack runs: `skip_crds`, `discovery: release_managed_only`,
`enable_remote_write_receiver`, Alertmanager, Grafana, both `exporters`,
every `control_plane_scrapers` entry and `default_rules` off, plus
`helm_values` `prometheusOperator.enabled: false` (no typed switch yet).
The first stack's operator watches every namespace and runs the
receiver's Prometheus; a second operator would fight it, and any scraper
left on is scraped twice, because the first stack discovers monitors
cluster-wide. Never make the first stack the receiver: its rules would
run over every remote cluster's samples and post each of their alerts
again. Size the receiver's
`prometheus.prometheusSpec.tsdb.outOfOrderTimeWindow` (also
`helm_values` today) to what a sender can resend, about two hours of
write-ahead log; without it the receiver refuses samples more than about
an hour older than its newest, so a longer outage leaves a gap. On the
sending side, `external_labels` ride every remote-written series, added
only where the series lacks the label. The whole composition, with the
door senders write through:
[observability-stack pattern](../../_patterns/observability-stack.md),
"Several clusters, one hub".

## Scrape only what the cluster can show you

The defaults scrape a control plane you own. On a managed one (GKE, EKS,
AKS) the controller manager, scheduler and etcd are the provider's and
unreachable, and kube-proxy's metrics port usually binds to localhost:
switch those `control_plane_scrapers` off AND name their groups in
`default_rules.disabled_groups` (`kubeControllerManager`, `etcd`,
`kubeSchedulerAlerting`, `kubeSchedulerRecording`, `kubeProxy`). A scraper
left on is a target that is down forever and a `TargetDown` that never
clears; a rule group left on is an alert that can never fire truthfully.
GKE runs kube-dns instead of CoreDNS, so nothing answers on CoreDNS's
metrics port there: set `core_dns: false` too, and watch kube-dns with a
[KubernetesPodMonitor](../kubernetespodmonitor/GUIDE.md) on `k8s-app:
kube-dns` in kube-system, port `metrics` (its sidecar's 10054, whose probe
series `kubedns_probe_kubedns_errors` and `..._latency_ms` say whether
cluster DNS answers and how fast). The check that the posture is right:
minutes after install, every active target reads `up`.

The components the cluster's own composition installs before this stack
(the gateway, istiod, cert-manager, external-dns, the database operator)
cannot carry their own monitor switches, because the monitor CRDs arrive
with this stack: watch each kind from this stack's composition with one
cluster-wide class monitor (the pattern's "Scraping as declared objects").

## Quiet the curated rules where they misread the cluster

The curated rules assume a cluster that holds still. Two common postures
break that assumption, and every alert that misreads the cluster teaches
the people reading the channel to stop reading it before a real page
arrives:

- **Autoscaled node pools.** `KubeCPUOvercommit` and
  `KubeMemoryOvercommit` ask whether the cluster could lose its largest
  node, counting the nodes it has now. With an autoscaler that adds a node
  when pods can't fit, every burst trips them and resolves minutes later.
  Name both in `default_rules.disabled_alerts`: on these pools capacity is
  the autoscaler's job, and a pod that truly cannot fit still shows up as
  `KubePodNotReady` (Pending for 15 minutes).
- **Work that is busy or not ready on purpose.** CI build pods (Tekton's
  task pods read not-ready once their first step ends), dedicated build or
  batch machines running at full CPU. Don't just silence the alert for
  everyone: **replace it**. Leave the curated alert out with
  `disabled_alerts`, then declare the same alert name in a
  `KubernetesPrometheusRule` whose expression leaves out what the cluster
  does on purpose (`kube_pod_owner{owner_kind!~"Job|TaskRun"}` for build
  pods; `unless` the machine carries your build taint, from
  `kube_node_spec_taint`, for build machines). Leave every pod ON a build
  machine out of the not-ready replacement too (join `kube_pod_info` to
  the taint): when a packed build machine runs out of memory and goes
  dark, its log collector, node agents and the builds' affinity
  assistants all go not ready together, an echo of the machine's failure.
  Name that failure once, with a short-hold alert on the build machines'
  free memory, because the cloud replaces a dark machine inside the 15
  minutes `KubeNodeNotReady` waits. Both series ship with
  kube-state-metrics and need no label allowlist. Keep the upstream name,
  `for` and severity, so runbooks and habits carry over, and keep the
  labels Alertmanager's inhibitions and your routes read (`namespace`,
  `severity`).

`alert_overrides` changes a curated alert that stays on: a longer `for`
(the hold before it fires) or another `severity` (which moves it to
another route). Upstream exposes exactly these two per alert.

A name that matches no rule changes nothing and nothing reports it, so
after any change read the rules Prometheus loaded:
`curl -s <prometheus>/api/v1/rules?type=alert` lists every alert by name.
A switched-off alert must be absent, and its replacement present once.

Two curated alerts are worth replacing once your own rules exist. The
remote-write lag alert (`PrometheusRemoteWriteBehind`) names no component
and links no runbook; your replacement can also catch an agent whose queue
to the hub is gone (`absent(prometheus_remote_storage_queue_highest_sent_timestamp_seconds{remote_name="<name>"})`),
which the curated one cannot. Rules that join pods (`kube_pod_info` to
readiness) should match on `uid` as well as `(namespace, pod)`: after a
StatefulSet pod is recreated under its name, the old series linger for
five minutes and a name-only join refuses to evaluate, the curated
node-exporter joins included. The pattern's alert section
([observability-stack](../../_patterns/observability-stack.md)) carries the
rest: environment labels set in the rule, burn rules on a gateway,
backups held to the database's age, the watcher watched, and silences.

## Alerts that reach a person

Out of the box Alertmanager notifies nobody. Monitoring exists only when
a deliberately fired alert has reached someone, so declare
`alertmanager.notifications` with the stack, not later, and prove it the
same day. Five things decide whether it works:

- **Credentials are managed-secret references.** Discord webhook URLs,
  Pushover keys and bearer tokens are `$secret/<slug>` values; the
  module writes them into its own Secret, mounts it, and renders `_file`
  fields, so no credential lands in chart values. A rotated secret is
  picked up on the next notification with no restart (proven live).
- **Wire the heartbeat on day one.** The always-firing Watchdog alert,
  posted to a monitor OUTSIDE the cluster every `heartbeat.interval`, is
  the only thing that notices when Alertmanager or the whole cluster
  dies. Keep the interval well under the monitor's staleness window (1m
  for a 5-minute window). Install first and see the heartbeat arrive
  before telling the monitor to expect the cluster, or it opens with a
  false "cluster silent" alert. Stopped on purpose, a 5-minute window
  pages about five and a half minutes later.
- **Pages and channels split by label, and `continue_matching` has a
  trap.** Route `severity=page` (only on rules where a person must act
  now) to a pager receiver. The root receiver takes only alerts no child
  route claims, so a continuing page route with nothing after it never
  reaches the channel: give the pager receiver both integrations
  (Pushover plus the channel's Discord), or follow it with a catch-all
  channel route.
- **Messages carry no customer names.** Every title is `[<environment>]
  <component>: <alertname>` (an alert without `component` is titled by its
  scrape `job`, and one with neither, such as an overcommit sum, by
  `cluster`), and the body is the alert's
  `customer_impact` annotation (else `summary`) plus `runbook_url`.
  `namespace`, `pod` and `description` are never rendered, because on a
  shared cluster a namespace can name a customer. Put `environment` on
  every alert through `prometheus.external_labels`, and `component` on
  your own rules.
- **Pushover's emergency priority repeats until acknowledged**, even
  after the alert resolves: Alertmanager cannot cancel it (proven live:
  it kept ringing after the resolve and after the resolved notice, which
  arrives one `group_interval`, 5 minutes by default, later). Whoever
  holds the phone acknowledges in the app.

Typed Discord delivery needs chart 88 or later (Prometheus Operator
v0.93): older operators re-parse the configuration and refuse Discord's
`webhook_url_file`, so Alertmanager never starts even though `amtool
check-config` passes. When Alertmanager does not appear, read the
Alertmanager resource's `Reconciled` condition first; the operator's
reason is there.

Prove it: `kubectl exec` into the Alertmanager pod and run `amtool alert
add alertname=Drill severity=warning environment=<env>
--alertmanager.url=http://localhost:9093`; it must arrive in the
channel. Then `amtool config routes test
--config.file=/etc/alertmanager/config_out/alertmanager.env.yaml
severity=page environment=<env>` must name the pager. Pass each label as
its own argument (in zsh, a label list held in one variable reaches
`amtool` as one malformed label and every route test reads the root), and
double-quote a value that has spaces inside the argument:
`--annotation='summary="Drill: no action needed."'`.

## The bundled Grafana boundary

The stack ships a Grafana pre-loaded with its dashboards — enough when
this stack is the only datasource. The moment dashboards must read Loki,
Tempo, or anything else, the standalone
[KubernetesGrafana](../kubernetesgrafana/GUIDE.md) is the
composition hub; run it INSTEAD of the bundled one, not beside it.

## On the diagram

The stack renders as a shared-layer node; a standalone Grafana draws a
datasource edge into its `prometheus_endpoint`, and Loki's alert routing
can draw an edge into its Alertmanager. The serviceMonitor dependency,
like every prerequisite-shaped coupling
([operator-prerequisite pattern](../../_patterns/operator-prerequisite.md)),
draws NOTHING — reviewers check
for the stack node whenever any component's monitoring toggle is on.

## Pairs well with

- KubernetesGrafana — the hub, when datasources go beyond this stack.
- KubernetesLoki — log alerts routed through this Alertmanager
  (`ruler.alertmanagerUrl`).
- Every kind with a serviceMonitor toggle — they all assume this stack.
