# KubernetesStrimziKafkaOperator Guide

The judgment this guide carries: installing this operator is necessary
but not sufficient — its WATCH SCOPE decides which namespaces' Kafka
clusters actually get reconciled, and the default (its own namespace
only) is almost never what a platform installation wants.

## Set the watch scope deliberately

The platform shape is one operator in the shared-cluster chart with
`watch.anyNamespace: true`, so every application environment can declare
Kafka clusters without touching the shared-cluster layer again. Use
`watch.namespaces` (a fenced list) when team isolation genuinely requires
it — accepting that every new Kafka-bearing namespace then needs a
shared-chart change. Leaving the watch block empty confines the operator
to its own namespace: correct only when the Kafka clusters live there
too. The scope vocabulary and multi-install rules are on
[reference.md](v1alpha1/reference.md).

## Once per cluster, in the shared-cluster chart

One operator reconciles any number of Kafka clusters. Declare it once in
the shared-cluster chart; application environments declare
KubernetesKafka clusters, never their own operator. (A second install is
a special, fenced shape — its constraints are on the reference page.)

## Namespace ownership — the infra exception

A dedicated single-tenant namespace with `createNamespace: true` is the
normal shape here — the
[namespace-ownership pattern](../../_patterns/namespace-ownership.md)'s
sole-tenant case.

## On the diagram

The operator renders in the shared-cluster layer, and — as the
[operator-prerequisite pattern](../../_patterns/operator-prerequisite.md)
explains — no edge connects a Kafka cluster to it. When reviewing an
architecture with Kafka in it, verify the operator node exists and its
watch scope covers the cluster's namespace; the diagram alone will not
surface a mismatch.

## Pairs well with

- KubernetesKafka — the clusters this operator reconciles (see its
  [guide](../kuberneteskafka/GUIDE.md)).
- KubernetesKafkaTopic / KubernetesKafkaUser — reconciled by each
  cluster's entity operators, which this operator manages.
