# Azure VPN Gateway Connection -- Operational Guide

Judgment that does not fit in field references.

## Provisioned is not connected -- believe it

A Succeeded deployment means ARM accepted the parameters, nothing
more. The tunnel reaches Connected only when the branch device
negotiates: matching pre-shared key, compatible proposals, reachable
endpoint. Debug a Connecting tunnel on the BRANCH side first (key,
ciphers, firewall) -- redeploying the Azure side rarely changes
anything.

## The link pin is permanent; the link set is not

Each tunnel's `vpnSiteLinkId` is fixed at creation -- repointing a
tunnel at a different site link means replacing that tunnel (cheap:
seconds of renegotiation, no gateway impact). ADDING a tunnel for a
branch's new second ISP is an in-place update; do that instead of
editing the existing one.

## Let Azure generate keys unless the branch cannot

An omitted `sharedKey` gets an Azure-generated value -- strong and
never in a manifest. Set the key only when the branch device demands a
pre-agreed one, and then REFERENCE a secret; the field is sensitive
and reference-capable for exactly that. One key per tunnel, both ends
identical.

One caveat, proven live: the generated key is NOT readable back
through this resource -- reads return it empty, so nothing in the
deployment outputs (or an import) will ever carry it. If your
workflow needs the key in hand to configure the branch device, set
it explicitly via a secret reference; treat generate-and-omit as the
posture for lab tunnels and for branches configured from the Azure
side out-of-band.

## Pinned proposals fail closed

With `ipsecPolicies` set, the tunnel offers EXACTLY that proposal --
there is no fallback to Azure's defaults. A branch device that would
have negotiated fine against the default set can go dark after
pinning. Pin from the device vendor's documented matrix, not from a
generic hardening guide; with GCM IKE encryption, use the MATCHING GCM
integrity value (ARM's rule, enforced by the spec vocabulary).

## BGP is a three-object agreement

A BGP tunnel needs: the site link's `bgp` block (the branch speaker),
this link's `bgpEnabled` (fixed at creation), and agreement on ASNs
(the gateway is 65515; the branch must differ and avoid
65515-65520). Miss any leg and routes silently fall back to the
site's static `addressCidrs` -- traffic may still flow, masking the
misconfiguration until the static list drifts.

## Internet security changes the branch's default route

`internetSecurityEnabled: true` advertises 0.0.0.0/0 down the tunnel
-- the branch's internet traffic now hairpins through Azure. Enable it
deliberately, paired with a hub firewall (routing intent); enabling it
"because security" on a branch with local breakout expectations is a
support ticket, not a hardening win.
