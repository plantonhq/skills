title: Authoring Configuration as a Git-Owned Kustomize Tree
description: Moving a service's per-environment configuration between the record and its repository — eject (the tree becomes the writer), checkout (the record materialized into files, authorship unchanged), init (a fresh skeleton), and patch-schema (the merge schema that keeps name-keyed lists merging). Read when someone wants their service config in git, wants files from what the platform has, asks what the _kustomize layout means, or wants authorship back.

# Authoring Configuration as a Git-Owned Kustomize Tree

Every service's per-environment configuration lives in ONE place: the record's `deploy.environments`. What varies is who WRITES it. A manually-declared service is written by whoever applies it (console, agent, `service.yaml`). A git-maintained service declares `deploy.kustomize`, and from then on the platform's own build lane writes the record from the repository's kustomize tree — a push on a branch that drives an environment syncs exactly that environment's entries, provenance stamped. These verbs move between the two worlds.

## The four verbs

- **`planton service kustomize eject <service>`** — hand authorship to the repository. Writes the record's declared configuration into a tree (one overlay per environment, one file per resource, the merge schema included), PROVES the tree renders back identical to the record, then — after an explicit confirmation — declares the tree as the writer. Run it from the repository's project root; commit and push the tree it writes.
- **`planton service kustomize checkout <service>`** — the record as files, authorship unchanged. Use it to inspect configuration, seed a repository before ejecting, or rebuild a tree from what the record currently carries.
- **`planton service kustomize init --env <slug> [--env <slug>...]`** — a fresh skeleton for hand-authoring: empty overlays plus the schema. Touches no record.
- **`planton service kustomize patch-schema --dir <tree>`** — regenerate `planton-schema.json` in an existing tree. Idempotent; run after platform schema upgrades.

## Why ejecting is safe to recommend

Two facts make eject a calm act, not a migration:

1. **The record's entries STAY through the flip.** Ejecting never empties anything — the tree was verified to render byte-identical to the record before the flip, so the first authoritative push converges onto the existing entries and writes nothing. Nothing redeploys because of an eject.
2. **It is reversible.** Removing the `deploy.kustomize` declaration (edit `service.yaml`, or apply the record without it) is the deliberate authorship takeover: the configuration entries stand, sync provenance is stripped, and the caller writes again.

While a service is git-maintained, manual edits to `deploy.environments` are preserved-from-record rather than accepted — the tree is the writer, so the honest way to change configuration is a commit. Relay that rather than helping someone fight the guard.

## The tree layout

```
_kustomize/
  planton-schema.json          # the merge schema (generated; commit it)
  overlays/<env>/              # one per deploy environment — the overlay SET
    kustomization.yaml         #   defines which environments the service deploys to
    <resource>.yaml            # full cloud-resource manifests
  dev/<flavor>/                # local-development flavors: NEVER deployed, never synced
    kustomization.yaml         #   (compose an overlay, patch laptop deltas)
  previews/<env>/              # pull-request preview deltas for that environment: rendered
    kustomization.yaml         #   per PR run, never synced (compose the env's overlay,
                               #   patch what previews change — see preview-environments.md)
```

Ejected trees are written self-contained: each overlay carries complete manifests, no computed base/patches. Factoring shared configuration into a `base/` with strategic-merge patches is the human's own refactor — the platform renders whatever the tree says, so any refactor that renders the same is equally valid. When someone refactors, the schema matters (next section).

## The merge schema, and why losing it hurts

`planton-schema.json` tells kustomize that name-keyed lists (env vars, ports) MERGE across base and patches instead of replacing wholesale. Without it, a patch that sets one env var silently DROPS every other env var in the base's list — a semantics change nobody sees until a deploy is missing half its configuration. The schema is generated, committed, and referenced by every overlay's `kustomization.yaml` (`openapi: path:`). If a tree predates it or a kustomization lost the reference, `patch-schema` repairs both.

## Walking the refusals

- **"already git-maintained"** (eject): the tree already writes this service — `checkout` materializes files, or take authorship back first if the goal is manual control.
- **"declares no per-environment configuration"** (eject/checkout): the record is empty — declare environments first (console, agent, or `service.yaml`), or for a git-maintained service push a driving branch so the sync populates the record.
- **"is git-maintained but no push has synced its tree onto the record yet"** (checkout): the repository itself is the source of truth — clone it instead of checking out.
- **"already exists and is not empty"**: the target directory holds files — generated output never silently mixes into existing work; `--force` overrides deliberately.
